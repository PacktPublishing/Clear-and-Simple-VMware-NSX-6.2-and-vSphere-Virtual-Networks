## About the Video Course
VMware NSX is the most disruptive network technology in recent memory. Demand for employees who understand NSX will continue to grow as the product reaches maturity. This course is designed to help you understand all of the concepts behind NSX. We'll start at the very beginning, and learn basic networking. If you are a vSphere Administrator with a limited networking background, this will be a huge help. We'll then learn about the networking tools included with vSphere Enterprise Plus, including the Standard and Distributed virtual switches. Basic concepts such as port groups and VMkernel ports will be explained in a clear and simple manner. We'll also look deeper into the feature set, covering topics such as private VLANs, port mirroring, and network I/O control.
NSX will be covered in a few different sections. First we'll learn the basics about NSX objects, and differentiate between management, control, and data planes. From there we'll delve deeply into switching and routing functions within NSX. We'll also cover security, and how NSX can provide microsegmentation. We explain how Service Composer can be used to provide third-party integration. And we'll look at Cross-vCenter NSX, which was released with NSX 6.2. This course will also help you prepare for the VMware VCP6-NV exam. In order to take the VCP6-NV exam you will need to complete some course requirements from VMware as well. Be sure to check those out as you prepare to get certified. This course will also help you prepare for the VMware vSphere 6.5 Foundations exam. We can also provide Lab Rentals with manuals that you can use as a companion to this course.
