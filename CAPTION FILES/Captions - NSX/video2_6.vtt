00:01.210 --> 00:08.520
In this video We'll cover some IP network basics and when I say the basics I really mean just the very

00:08.520 --> 00:16.800
basics and we're not going to give a full C cna a level class on routing and protocols and all of that

00:16.800 --> 00:17.690
sort of stuff.

00:18.090 --> 00:24.150
But I just want to give you some of the most basic concepts and that way as we kind of work our way

00:24.150 --> 00:31.650
into more advanced topics and other videos like NSX and the distributed logical router you'll be able

00:31.650 --> 00:37.070
to understand those concepts because you'll have a basic understanding of IP networking.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.970
So let's take a look at our diagram here.

00:41.970 --> 00:45.930
And in the diagram we can see we have two different networks.

00:46.170 --> 00:53.510
And on the top we've got the network I'm calling it the tenth one that one does zero slash 24 network

00:54.710 --> 00:58.110
and that is our IP network.

00:58.130 --> 01:03.750
So that means on this network we have a splash 24 subnet mask.

01:03.950 --> 01:13.240
That means that the first 24 bits are part of the network address and the remaining 8 bits or my 0.

01:13.600 --> 01:17.770
That's part of the host range of IPs.

01:17.790 --> 01:25.860
So based on that we can kind of ascertain here the range of IP addresses available is 10 1 1 0 through

01:25.860 --> 01:28.140
turned out 1.1 to 55.

01:29.750 --> 01:34.550
We typically do not use this first address turned out 1.1 0.

01:34.790 --> 01:41.530
That's the address of our network and we don't use have not one not one 2:55 unless we have to do broadcasts.

01:42.020 --> 01:53.520
So our actual usable range of IP addresses will be 10 that 1.1 one through 10 out 1.1 254.

01:53.770 --> 02:00.850
And I've got these machines connected to the same switch could be a physical switch could be a virtual

02:00.850 --> 02:01.420
switch.

02:01.630 --> 02:09.310
Regardless I've got these machines on this network connected to the same switch and here's a letter

02:09.310 --> 02:10.940
to domain right.

02:10.940 --> 02:17.400
Here's a letter to network inner connecting devices that are on the same IP address range

02:21.830 --> 02:22.120
well.

02:22.130 --> 02:29.870
What happens when my machines that are on this network want to talk to devices that are on some other

02:29.870 --> 02:30.530
network.

02:33.860 --> 02:38.490
We're going to have to use something called our default gateway.

02:38.660 --> 02:42.260
And in that case that's this router that we have pictured here.

02:44.870 --> 02:49.050
So the router is going to act as our default gateway for our machines.

02:49.100 --> 02:52.970
And again this is true if you have physical machines virtual machines it doesn't matter.

02:52.970 --> 02:55.620
You'll go into the guest operating system.

02:55.670 --> 02:57.010
Let's assume it's Windows.

02:57.200 --> 03:01.640
You'll go into windows and you'll configure a default gateway for your machine.

03:01.730 --> 03:10.350
And what that default gateway means is basically anything that's on some other network.

03:10.430 --> 03:19.740
Anything that falls outside of this IP address range that traffic needs to be sent to the default gateway

03:20.040 --> 03:23.580
so that it can be routed to other network.

03:23.650 --> 03:30.400
We can't have machines from different networks on the same layer 2 domain.

03:30.640 --> 03:37.210
We can't have virtual machines or physical machines on the same switching segment if they're on different

03:37.210 --> 03:38.420
layer three networks.

03:38.440 --> 03:43.100
So that's what we're going to use that default gateway for.

03:43.120 --> 03:49.540
So when you think of that default gateway that configuration that you do when Windows basically all

03:49.540 --> 03:57.840
you're saying is for any traffic that is on some network other than this network send that traffic to

03:57.840 --> 04:03.130
my default gateway and the default gateway is a router.

04:03.150 --> 04:08.720
The router works at Layer 3 of the same model.

04:08.730 --> 04:14.810
So let's say for example we have a machine here 10 1.1 1.

04:15.450 --> 04:29.580
And it goes in it sends some traffic towards 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 2 machine on the 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 0 network.

04:31.700 --> 04:40.070
Well that traffic is going to be directed towards the default gateway and the default gateway will receive

04:40.100 --> 04:40.980
that packet.

04:41.180 --> 04:43.220
And here's what that packet looks like.

04:46.220 --> 04:52.430
When the packet arrives at the router it will have a source and destination IP address and the router

04:52.430 --> 04:59.840
will open up that packet and it will essentially analyze the contents of that packet and it will say

04:59.840 --> 05:09.140
OK the source IP is coming from 10 not one not one not two the destination IP isn't $192 168 not one

05:09.140 --> 05:16.460
not two and the router at this point will realize I've got an interface on that network.

05:16.520 --> 05:22.090
I've got an interface on the one nine 2.1 six say not one not two network.

05:22.610 --> 05:29.990
And so it'll for that packet towards that network where it can eventually reach the destination virtual

05:29.990 --> 05:33.670
machine.

05:33.690 --> 05:41.970
So what the router is essentially doing in our network here is its inter connecting multipole layer

05:41.970 --> 05:43.320
to networks.

05:43.410 --> 05:51.850
It knows how to get to each of those networks by using its routing table and is going to receive traffic

05:51.850 --> 05:58.140
from one network and forward it to the appropriate network.

05:58.150 --> 06:02.650
And so what the router will have is something called a routing table which I just mentioned.

06:02.800 --> 06:10.770
And in this scenario we've got this router and it's connected directly to these two switches.

06:10.840 --> 06:18.810
So let's assume it has a direct connection to these two ethernet switches the router is always going

06:18.810 --> 06:25.860
to be aware of those directly connected networks will configure IP addresses on those router interfaces

06:26.580 --> 06:33.390
and it will automatically be aware of those directly connected networks and it will build entries in

06:33.390 --> 06:36.680
its routing table to reflect those networks.

06:38.490 --> 06:43.920
So here's what our routing table will look like and it looks something like this will have interfaces

06:44.580 --> 06:49.040
on the router and will have networks associated with those interfaces.

06:49.050 --> 06:57.630
So for any packets that are bound for the 10.0 dot 1.0 network the router for those packets our interface

06:57.630 --> 07:03.620
one and if those packets are bound for the 1 2 1 6 8 dot one does their own network.

07:03.810 --> 07:06.440
Those packets will be forwarded out interface too.

07:06.450 --> 07:11.580
Now this is really the most basic iteration of the routing table.

07:11.580 --> 07:18.720
There is a lot of other ways that our routing table entries can be populated and updated.

07:18.720 --> 07:24.750
We can use static routes we can use dynamic routing protocols but thats not really what I want to get

07:24.750 --> 07:26.130
into here.

07:26.220 --> 07:32.940
I just want to show you the basic concept of a router what its job is and what a routing table looks

07:32.940 --> 07:33.580
like.

07:34.340 --> 07:39.180
And we're not going to get into how to build a dynamic routing table or anything like that just yet.

07:42.700 --> 07:44.980
One final item of review.

07:45.190 --> 07:49.850
Just to kind of talk about our OS II model let's bring it back to the OS model.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.890
Let's look at our Lares here.

07:52.240 --> 07:58.390
So I have a machine that is physically connected to the switch that physical cable.

07:58.450 --> 08:05.530
That's where one the physical cable between the switch and the router and this other switch and this

08:05.530 --> 08:14.110
other router interface those are all my layer one connections my physical media and the actual physical

08:14.290 --> 08:16.660
switch itself and the router itself.

08:16.660 --> 08:21.370
Those interfaces that's all of my Lehre one components

08:23.960 --> 08:25.340
at Layer 2.

08:25.550 --> 08:30.980
I have MAC addresses ethernet network.

08:31.050 --> 08:41.910
So when this machine 10.0 one want to send that packet towards its default gateway the IP addresses

08:41.910 --> 08:48.490
weren't the only IP addresses on their There was also a source and destination MAC address.

08:48.670 --> 08:52.310
That's my layer to addressing scheme.

08:52.400 --> 09:01.010
So if we take a deeper look at that packet Let's drill down into the source and destination MAC and

09:01.010 --> 09:11.220
the source and destination IP addresses to understand how ARE layer 2 and layer 3 addresses different.

09:11.360 --> 09:16.780
Here's a more detailed look at that same packet that we looked at before.

09:16.790 --> 09:24.350
So in this scenario again this virtual machine up here the 10.0 one not one not two is trying to communicate

09:24.350 --> 09:29.900
with $192 168 dot 1.2.

09:30.150 --> 09:38.220
And so because that destination is on a different note work what that source machine will do is it will

09:38.220 --> 09:45.360
send the freight to the default gateway.

09:45.500 --> 09:49.710
And so in this case the source Mac address is the mac address of this machine.

09:49.730 --> 09:51.280
Let's call it Mac A.

09:51.560 --> 09:54.870
The destination MAC is the MAC address of the router.

09:54.950 --> 09:58.790
Let's call it Mac or one.

09:58.930 --> 10:04.280
So one that either that frame gets sent out the router will receive it.

10:04.420 --> 10:11.150
It'll analyze the source and destination MAC and a little determine add a layer to level.

10:11.260 --> 10:13.220
This frame is bound for me.

10:13.460 --> 10:16.230
I'm the destination MAC address.

10:16.430 --> 10:23.320
At that point those source and destination MAC headers are gone.

10:23.320 --> 10:30.020
There are discarded we don't need the Mac counters anymore because at this point the communication all

10:30.130 --> 10:33.220
across our lair to network is complete.

10:33.340 --> 10:35.250
So let's dispose of these.

10:35.560 --> 10:42.610
And then at that point the router will analyze the layer three headers it will dig one layer deeper

10:43.380 --> 10:52.840
it will see the source IP is 10 dot one dot to and it will see that the destination IP is 192 not 168.

10:52.840 --> 10:57.880
Don't want to and the router will realize that's not me.

10:58.070 --> 11:02.630
I'm not the destination IP and this packet is not bound for me.

11:02.780 --> 11:08.120
It's bound for some other device on that 192 that 168.

11:08.320 --> 11:11.590
Not one not two network.

11:11.620 --> 11:17.020
So then it'll analyze its routing table and it will determine I've got an interface connected to that

11:17.020 --> 11:19.890
network.

11:19.900 --> 11:29.680
So what does this packet look like as it leaves the router and heads towards that destination machine.

11:32.300 --> 11:39.020
Well the first thing that we notice is the source and destination IP don't change that part is not going

11:39.020 --> 11:40.310
to change at all.

11:40.310 --> 11:46.160
We still have the same source IP which is this machine up here and we still have the same destination

11:46.160 --> 11:48.470
IP which is this machine down here.

11:48.680 --> 11:51.470
So the three addresses don't change at all.

11:51.680 --> 11:58.280
But from a layer to perspective the source of Mac as it leaves this router is now this interface on

11:58.280 --> 11:59.140
the router.

11:59.330 --> 12:04.140
And now the destination MAC is the MAC address of our receiving machine.

12:06.200 --> 12:13.580
So what I want to illustrate here is that these Lehre to MAC addresses they're unique to their layer

12:13.580 --> 12:14.450
2 segment.

12:14.480 --> 12:19.240
That's the only place that those addresses are significant.

12:19.280 --> 12:26.900
But when we saw frames flowing within this layer to domain up here those source and destination MAC

12:26.900 --> 12:34.010
addresses were relevant as soon as that frame gets routed by a router to some other layer to network

12:35.660 --> 12:42.830
those source and destination MAC addresses for Lapeer lose their significance and new source and destination

12:42.830 --> 12:48.850
MAC addresses are appendant.

12:48.870 --> 12:51.890
So what we see here is two ethernet domains.

12:51.930 --> 13:01.050
Right we have one ethernet domain appear one ethernet domain down here and they are interconnected by

13:01.050 --> 13:03.390
a layer 3 device a router.
