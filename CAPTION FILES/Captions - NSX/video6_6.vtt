00:00.330 --> 00:05.760
In this video we'll talk about the different cluster deployment options that we have with the NSX edge

00:05.850 --> 00:16.520
and how we should design NSX along with our virtual data center to ensure maximum performance and availability.

00:16.650 --> 00:22.740
So we have really three different cluster deployment options and this is for the underlying vse for

00:22.740 --> 00:26.310
environment that NSX is running on top of.

00:26.340 --> 00:30.800
So probably the simplest configuration is using a single cluster.

00:31.230 --> 00:37.020
We place all of the NSX components on the same cluster that are virtual machines run on.

00:37.260 --> 00:43.620
And again this is good for a small deployment type scenario where we don't have a whole lot of extra

00:43.620 --> 00:48.320
hosts to work with now as our environment grows.

00:48.390 --> 00:55.860
We get a little bit more flexibility and what we could do is we can establish something called a management

00:55.860 --> 01:00.430
cluster and in larger environments these are pretty common.

01:00.510 --> 01:09.000
So we'll have a group of VSX high hosts that things like V Center Update Manager NSX manager and maybe

01:09.000 --> 01:11.860
Active Directory domain controllers run on.

01:12.330 --> 01:14.340
And that's called the management cluster.

01:15.240 --> 01:21.810
We can also put our NSX virtual appliances on that cluster of hosts.

01:21.870 --> 01:28.740
And again this is good for larger deployments that can actually dedicate hosts specifically to these

01:28.740 --> 01:30.740
management and edge functions.

01:32.230 --> 01:34.020
Now why would we bother doing this.

01:34.090 --> 01:40.330
Why separate management venoms why separate edge VMS.

01:40.360 --> 01:45.660
There's a few reasons that we might use a collapsed engine management cluster.

01:45.910 --> 01:49.420
Number one we may have a regulatory requirement.

01:49.420 --> 01:57.140
We may need to keep management virtual machines on SEPA hardware or we may just want to isolate performance

01:57.140 --> 01:58.020
issues.

01:58.400 --> 02:04.670
So for example if some management virtual machines start chewing up a lot of resources we probably don't

02:04.760 --> 02:09.260
want that to affect our compute workloads.

02:09.290 --> 02:12.880
So that's kind of the rationale to have a separate cluster.

02:13.220 --> 02:21.350
And we can again put adj virtual machines and management the OM's on that same cluster or if we have

02:21.350 --> 02:29.300
a really large vse fear deployment we might actually be able to create three clusters one for management

02:29.690 --> 02:33.610
one cluster for adj and one compute cluster.

02:33.640 --> 02:41.680
And again this is good for the largest environments where we can have a group of hosts specifically

02:41.680 --> 02:43.750
dedicated to each function.

02:43.840 --> 02:49.690
Right so maybe we have multiple compute clusters and then we'll have a single management cluster with

02:49.690 --> 02:56.710
things like V Center things like NSX manager with things like our NSX control or cluster.

02:56.710 --> 03:03.870
Those are all great candidates for a management closter and at the edge cluster we can have our edge

03:03.870 --> 03:07.480
of virtual appliances.

03:07.870 --> 03:14.150
So let's take a little bit of a look at what this looks like in a few diagrams.

03:14.210 --> 03:20.110
Here we see an NSX deployment in a single cluster and up at the top left you can see in the light green

03:20.110 --> 03:23.740
box we have an ESX host cluster.

03:23.740 --> 03:31.740
So here's a single cluster of ESX I hosts and we're going to put everything within this one single cluster.

03:31.790 --> 03:37.730
So here we have some virtual machines that are considered compute workloads and these are application

03:37.760 --> 03:41.760
type virtual machines or databases or things like that.

03:42.020 --> 03:42.200
Right.

03:42.200 --> 03:47.100
And they can run on any of the ESX hosts in this particular cluster.

03:47.270 --> 03:51.040
This is a cluster that's basically doing everything.

03:51.350 --> 03:56.690
Not only is that housing those compute workloads but it's got other virtual machines on it like V Center

03:56.690 --> 04:01.910
like NSX manager and it's got our edge virtual appliances as well.

04:04.270 --> 04:11.320
So again this deployment model is very well suited towards our smaller environments as the environment

04:11.350 --> 04:12.320
grows.

04:12.490 --> 04:20.750
We may want to consider creating a cluster that's dedicated to management and at each and now we'll

04:20.750 --> 04:28.640
put things like Wii center in our NSX edge virtual appliances and the NSX controller cluster are this

04:28.670 --> 04:34.680
dedicated cluster of ESX hosts that specifically for those purposes.

04:38.010 --> 04:45.450
Now finally in the largest of environments we may have one or more clusters that are completely dedicated

04:45.450 --> 04:47.300
to compute.

04:47.900 --> 04:52.820
And those are all of our application VMT database volume's all of those sorts of things.

04:53.910 --> 04:59.160
Then we can have a cluster that's specifically dedicated to management for things like Active Directory

04:59.670 --> 05:07.830
things like again V Center update manager and NSX manager and OS X controller closter.

05:07.980 --> 05:13.470
And then finally we've got our edge cluster which is dedicated to hosts that are really just providing

05:13.770 --> 05:20.910
ingress and egress to and from the external network that can be our NSX edge cluster.

05:20.910 --> 05:27.720
And again this option with separate clusters for each purpose is really for those larger environments

05:27.780 --> 05:33.540
where you have the kind of budget that you can buy a few hosts just for management and that you can

05:33.540 --> 05:35.920
buy a couple of hosts just as an cluster.
