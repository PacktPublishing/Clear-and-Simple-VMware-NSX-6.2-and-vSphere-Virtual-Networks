00:00.520 --> 00:07.560
In this video I'll explain the fundamentals of cross V Center and NSX and explain how this new feature

00:07.590 --> 00:17.220
in NSX that too can be utilized to create an NSX deployment that spans multiple The Center instances.

00:17.230 --> 00:21.720
So in this lesson we'll cover the fundamentals of cross V Center NSX.

00:21.730 --> 00:29.590
We'll look at some use cases and we'll differentiate between universal and logical objects.

00:29.590 --> 00:35.620
Let's start by talking a little bit about NSX without cross V Center and SATs.

00:35.920 --> 00:44.110
So a typical NSX deployment includes things like NSX manager every NSX deployment has to have an NSX

00:44.110 --> 00:53.080
manager instance that's registered to the center so we have to have an avid sex controller cluster will

00:53.120 --> 01:02.930
have components like the distributed alogical router and logical switches transport zones and the distributed

01:02.930 --> 01:04.680
firewall.

01:04.830 --> 01:13.870
So we're going to have all of these components that make up a typical single center NSX deployment and

01:13.870 --> 01:21.310
the scope of our logical switches and our distributed logical router will be determined by the transport

01:21.310 --> 01:21.920
zone.

01:23.340 --> 01:30.750
And the transport zones are limited to the hosts and clusters that are managed by a single center instance.

01:30.780 --> 01:38.790
So if you have another center instance there is no way to create a logical switch that spans both inventory's

01:39.990 --> 01:42.340
now an NSX 6.2.

01:42.360 --> 01:44.720
This is changed.

01:44.790 --> 01:53.430
Now we can associate multiple NSX manager instances and manage them from a single interface.

01:55.160 --> 02:04.910
We can create all their two layer 3 and firewall components that can span multiple V Center deployments

02:09.360 --> 02:20.840
so NSX 2 or later supports this cross the center NSX feature and it allows us to modify the scope of

02:20.840 --> 02:22.590
our sex objects.

02:23.850 --> 02:30.450
Right now the scope of our logical switches and distributed logical routers are defined by the transport

02:30.450 --> 02:32.380
zone.

02:32.500 --> 02:40.840
If we have the ability to create transport zones that span multiple V Center inventories now we can

02:40.840 --> 02:50.120
create objects like logical switches that can also span those V Center inventory's so with cross we

02:50.120 --> 02:56.630
center our NSX we can create logical switches distributed firewall rules and distributed logical routers

02:56.900 --> 03:00.440
that span multiple V Center instances.

03:03.940 --> 03:07.480
So here we see a transport zone of a standard NSX deployment.

03:07.960 --> 03:14.230
And in this scenario all of the clusters are managed by a single center server on the left.

03:14.230 --> 03:17.740
We have our dev cluster with our dev hosts on the right.

03:17.800 --> 03:24.900
We have our production cluster with our production hosts and we can create transport zones that include

03:24.900 --> 03:28.500
some or all of those clusters.

03:28.550 --> 03:33.700
So in this scenario transport Zone B includes the dev cluster.

03:33.980 --> 03:41.130
And so if I create a logical switch like Vienna five thousand one that's associated with transport Zone

03:41.150 --> 03:49.990
B that logical switch will only be presented to those dev hosts.

03:49.990 --> 03:56.620
Now if I create another transport zone such as transport Zone A that's associated with multiple clusters

03:57.400 --> 04:04.810
and then I create a logical switch such as V.N. five thousand two associated with transport Zone A.

04:05.170 --> 04:14.320
That logical switch will span all of those hosts and I'll essentially have a layer 2 network that VM

04:14.320 --> 04:20.230
is on any of those hosts can connect to and can communicate via Lerer too.

04:20.300 --> 04:22.080
This is a local transport zone.

04:24.740 --> 04:30.300
With cross V Center NSX we have another option called a universal transport zone.

04:31.850 --> 04:40.010
So what do we use to define the scope of our alogical switches in Cross center and Isaak's we use transport

04:40.010 --> 04:44.460
zones only they're called a universal transport zone now.

04:44.910 --> 04:54.270
And any logical switches that we create in that universal transport zone will span both resetter instances.

04:55.260 --> 05:00.330
Now we can still have traditional logical switches and transport zones as well.

05:00.330 --> 05:06.810
So in our diagram here you can see we have one transport zone that's associated with the dev cluster

05:06.810 --> 05:08.110
still right.

05:08.110 --> 05:14.730
NF I create a logical switch associated with that transport zone that logical switch is only going to

05:14.730 --> 05:22.690
be present on those DAPH hosts but up towards the top of our diagram we also have a universal transport

05:22.690 --> 05:32.200
zone spanning multipole the center server inventory's and now I can create a universal logical switch

05:34.130 --> 05:38.000
that spans those different V Center instances.

05:38.000 --> 05:44.780
I can have a layer 2 network that is present at both of these sites and we'll talk about some of the

05:44.780 --> 05:48.710
applications for that in a moment such as disaster recovery.

05:49.040 --> 05:54.980
But before we get into that let's take a look at some of the other universal objects that we can create

05:55.070 --> 05:58.650
like distributed firewall rules.

05:58.750 --> 06:06.700
So let's assume that this virtual machine shown here has some sensitive information and we have protected

06:06.700 --> 06:13.510
it with a universal firewall rule and we've created a universal transporter zone and down towards the

06:13.510 --> 06:20.030
bottom of our screen we can see there's a universal logical switch that's available across multiple

06:20.030 --> 06:21.840
V centers server inventory's

06:25.170 --> 06:32.540
so we can use Wii motion to move this virtual machine from one Wii center inventory to another.

06:32.550 --> 06:35.190
This is supported in these fair sex.

06:35.190 --> 06:43.310
We have really relaxed the long distance Wii motion requirements and we've also enable crossover center

06:43.320 --> 06:45.500
every motion in these first six.

06:45.900 --> 06:52.860
So we take this V.M. and we motion it to a host that's managed by the other receptor shover and the

06:52.860 --> 07:00.250
universal firewall rules will come along with that virtual machine to its new cluster.

07:00.350 --> 07:07.110
There's a special section of our firewall configuration for universal firewalls and we can still create

07:07.200 --> 07:15.270
normal firewall rules and those rules will only apply to a specific NSX manager instance but we can

07:15.270 --> 07:19.310
also create those universal firewall rules as well.

07:20.680 --> 07:25.850
Now the number of features supported by the universal firewall rules is pretty limited.

07:26.830 --> 07:33.130
We don't have all of those service composer capabilities the universal firewall rules are basically

07:33.130 --> 07:34.930
going to be IP sense.

07:36.720 --> 07:42.180
But if that's what we need we can create those universal firewall rules and have them span multiple

07:42.360 --> 07:44.880
Center instances.

07:44.950 --> 07:47.600
Now let's talk about a couple of use cases.

07:47.750 --> 07:52.420
Let's say that we have multiple active production centers sharers.

07:52.670 --> 07:59.330
Maybe we have an active active data center scenario where we have some VM running at one data center

07:59.660 --> 08:07.550
and some victims running at another data center and we have a wide area network connection that is less

08:07.550 --> 08:13.760
than 150 milliseconds of latency round trip.

08:13.870 --> 08:24.040
If we can meet those requirements we can create a layer to spand universal logical switch.

08:24.070 --> 08:30.410
Now in order to do this we have to ensure that that empty you requirement is met for VX.

08:30.670 --> 08:35.600
So we'll have to have a 6500 or larger MCU between those sites.

08:37.130 --> 08:44.570
But now we've got the capability to create a consistent IP address scheme across these two sites.

08:44.600 --> 08:48.350
We have a layer 2 network that's available at both sites.

08:48.350 --> 08:55.130
And I can seamlessly move a VM from one site to another without any IP address changes.

08:55.130 --> 08:59.730
This gives us a whole lot of capabilities that we may not have had otherwise.

09:01.610 --> 09:08.840
And we can create those universal firewall rules to establish policies that go with that virtual machine

09:08.870 --> 09:16.130
as it moves from site to site and we can enable local egress at each site.

09:16.180 --> 09:23.080
So notice there is an edge of each site with connections to the Internet all of the traffic bound for

09:23.080 --> 09:29.470
the Internet and each site will flow out of that local gress specific to that site.

09:30.990 --> 09:33.130
That's one of our use cases.

09:33.270 --> 09:36.490
The other use case is disaster recovery.

09:36.690 --> 09:43.840
So let's say that we're doing disaster recovery with site recovery manager well and ASX six that too

09:43.840 --> 09:49.140
is going to synchronize and sex objects across these sites.

09:50.600 --> 09:56.070
So what we'll have in that scenario is logical switches that span both sites.

09:56.480 --> 10:02.360
And this is a really important thing for disaster recovery because what SRM is going to do is it's going

10:02.360 --> 10:04.480
to get the virtual machines back up.

10:04.610 --> 10:11.120
It's going to connect them to logical switches and usually a lot of the work that you have to do with

10:11.120 --> 10:19.160
site recovery manager is saying OK if the primary site fails this VM use that connect to this logical

10:19.160 --> 10:19.860
switch.

10:19.910 --> 10:24.830
Now it's connected to some other virtual switch at the recovery site.

10:24.860 --> 10:32.510
We don't have to do that if we have a logical switch that's universal when that primary site fails.

10:33.630 --> 10:39.480
Those VMS are going to be able to boot back up at the disaster recovery site.

10:41.610 --> 10:46.470
On the same virtual switch that they were using at their original site.

10:46.640 --> 10:54.500
So this overcomes the difficult disaster recovery challenge of setting up stretched layer 2 or readdressing

10:54.500 --> 10:57.130
all of our virtual machines.

10:57.170 --> 11:04.720
So in review we'll use cross recentre NSX to create universal objects such as universal logical switches

11:04.990 --> 11:08.980
universal firewalls and universal distributed logical routers.

11:09.880 --> 11:15.880
Our universal firewall rules will follow virtual machines from site to site regardless of which VI center

11:15.880 --> 11:17.960
instance they reside on.

11:19.190 --> 11:25.370
And we can still create those local objects if we want to just because we've deployed cross recentre

11:25.400 --> 11:31.590
and OS X doesn't mean that every logical switch we create is going to span multiple Center instances.

11:33.720 --> 11:38.760
The big benefit of crossfeed center NSX is that it allows the same where to network to be present at

11:38.760 --> 11:39.870
different sites.

11:39.870 --> 11:46.590
It also allows us to create a distributed logical router that is present at multiple sites as well.

11:48.550 --> 11:52.950
And it supports active active and disaster recovery applications.
