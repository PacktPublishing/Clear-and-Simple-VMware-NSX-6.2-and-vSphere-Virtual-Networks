In this video I'll explain transport zones and how they can be used to control the scope of our logical

00:07.110 --> 00:09.120
switches.

00:09.160 --> 00:11.170
So here we see a really simple diagram.

00:11.170 --> 00:16.440
I've got two clusters of ESX high hopes and just keep it really really simple.

00:16.480 --> 00:20.800
I only put two hosts in each cluster right so I have a cluster on the left.

00:20.800 --> 00:28.790
That's called the inside cluster and on the right I have a cluster called the DMZ cluster and maybe

00:28.790 --> 00:36.500
I want to create some logical switches but I don't necessarily want those logical switches to span both

00:36.500 --> 00:37.860
of these clusters.

00:37.930 --> 00:45.140
If I create a logical switch for the DMZ cluster I don't necessarily want VM on the inside cluster to

00:45.230 --> 00:48.550
also see that switch and be able to connect to it.

00:48.770 --> 00:56.590
I might want to keep those two environments separated so that I can do is I can create a transport zone.

00:56.810 --> 01:06.850
So let's go ahead and identify one transport zone I'll call it the DMZ transport zone and my DMZ transport

01:06.850 --> 01:11.730
zone is going to include certain clusters of ESX hosts.

01:11.740 --> 01:18.610
So in this case I've only included one cluster the DMZ cluster and let's create one more transport zone

01:18.610 --> 01:18.970
here.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.490
I'm going to call it the inside transport zone.

01:22.630 --> 01:29.380
And really similar to what I did on the DMZ side the only cluster's included in this transport zone

01:30.060 --> 01:32.210
are clusters that are on the inside of my network.

01:32.230 --> 01:34.050
The inside cost.

01:34.240 --> 01:42.630
Now I can go ahead and create a logical switch and when I do so I'll specify the transport zone that

01:42.670 --> 01:45.470
logical switch is going to be associated with.

01:45.940 --> 01:53.470
So for example let's say that I create a logical switch and I specify that it's going to exist on the

01:53.470 --> 01:56.790
DMZ transport zone.

01:56.790 --> 02:02.430
That means that that particular logical switch will only be available on the hosts that are part of

02:02.430 --> 02:04.130
that DMZ cluster.

02:04.230 --> 02:07.840
And so I can't connect via SMS on the inside cluster to it.

02:07.980 --> 02:16.250
And same thing if I create a logical switch and I associate it within the inside transport zone while

02:16.250 --> 02:24.440
that logical switch will only be available to those hosts that are within that inside transport zone.

02:24.470 --> 02:30.240
So now I can use these transport zones to define the scope of my logical switches.

02:31.630 --> 02:33.880
But we have more flexibility than this event.

02:34.120 --> 02:36.860
I can create a third transport zone.

02:37.030 --> 02:40.170
I'm going to call this one the global transport zone.

02:41.900 --> 02:47.750
And this transport zone is going to be a little bit different because now I'm creating one transport

02:47.750 --> 02:53.520
zone that actually spans both of these ESX I host clusters.

02:53.570 --> 03:02.150
So now if I create a logical switch within that global transport zone its going to span all of the ESX

03:02.150 --> 03:06.600
I hosts in both Klosters.

03:06.770 --> 03:13.250
So the effect is I can now create a logical switch that will be available on all of the hosts on the

03:13.250 --> 03:16.740
inside cluster and in the DMZ cluster.

03:16.900 --> 03:24.830
I've now created a layer 2 network that is available on both of these clusters and you have to be careful

03:24.830 --> 03:25.580
of this right.

03:25.580 --> 03:30.540
If these two clusters are supposed to be isolated from each other.

03:30.620 --> 03:36.320
Well if we start connecting via SMS on both clusters of the same logical switch we don't have a whole

03:36.320 --> 03:37.780
lot of isolation there.

03:37.850 --> 03:43.550
Now we could do some stuff with our distributed firewall rules but this might not be something in real

03:43.550 --> 03:45.870
life that you actually want to do.

03:46.190 --> 03:51.710
I just wanted to illustrate it here to demonstrate the flexibility that we have with these transport

03:51.710 --> 03:54.920
zones and what role they provide.
