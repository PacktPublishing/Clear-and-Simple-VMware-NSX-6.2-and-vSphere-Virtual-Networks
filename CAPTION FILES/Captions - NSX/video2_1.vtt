00:01.520 --> 00:04.300
In this video we're going to learn about the last time.

00:04.550 --> 00:11.410
And if you've dealt with networking for any period of time you've probably had some exposure to the

00:11.480 --> 00:12.840
same model.

00:12.860 --> 00:17.810
Now a lot of people don't really love to deal with the whole model or think about it.

00:18.110 --> 00:25.340
But really once you kind of demystify and explain what the model means and get used to working with

00:25.340 --> 00:33.300
it you'll find it really is an essential tool to kind of talk about networking protocols.

00:34.100 --> 00:43.970
So all of the OS I model really is is kind of like a logical representation of how our devices on a

00:43.970 --> 00:46.430
network can communicate with each other.

00:49.160 --> 00:55.430
And the job of the model is to break down all of the functions that have to get performed by these components

00:55.430 --> 01:02.940
that are connected to the network and then it breaks them down into simplified Lares.

01:02.990 --> 01:05.870
So let's start out with the very basics.

01:06.080 --> 01:08.220
What is oocyte stand for.

01:08.240 --> 01:09.880
What is the OS model.

01:10.130 --> 01:13.850
Well it stands for open system interconnect model

01:16.620 --> 01:19.630
and the model includes seven laris.

01:19.860 --> 01:26.460
And what I want to actually add in here is a little bit of an additional layer that I I sort of think

01:26.460 --> 01:28.750
at the top of the OS II model.

01:28.830 --> 01:35.710
Right so here we see the application presentation session and kind of on down the line towards the physical.

01:35.730 --> 01:35.930
Right.

01:35.940 --> 01:42.300
And that's the actual physical media like copper wire or fiber optic cable.

01:42.300 --> 01:49.080
And I like to put at the top of the model one additional layer and I call this layer simply the user

01:49.080 --> 01:52.180
layer right at the top of my model here.

01:52.260 --> 01:54.210
That's where the user resides.

01:54.420 --> 02:03.600
So as the information is flowing up through the OSA model it's getting closer to my user actually seeing

02:03.600 --> 02:05.780
and utilizing that data.

02:07.940 --> 02:15.080
So now that we have our user at the top of the OS II model let's look at the layer below that the application

02:15.080 --> 02:15.530
layer.

02:15.620 --> 02:17.690
And this is a really simple lair.

02:17.990 --> 02:20.360
This is what the user is going to use.

02:20.360 --> 02:22.260
This is what the user is going to see.

02:22.390 --> 02:26.050
Right this is some application like Outlook for e-mail.

02:26.110 --> 02:26.790
Right.

02:27.290 --> 02:36.050
And so this is what the user themselves will actually interact with and utilize to receive this data.

02:37.560 --> 02:46.910
The next layer is the presentation layer the presentation and session layers are actually pretty closely

02:46.910 --> 02:48.760
linked to each other.

02:48.770 --> 02:55.460
Think of these as the things that my operating system needs to do to communicate with some other operating

02:55.460 --> 02:56.690
system.

02:56.810 --> 03:03.550
For example I could have Windows running on my machine and I may be establishing a session with another

03:03.560 --> 03:04.910
Windows machine.

03:04.910 --> 03:11.450
That's what the presentation and session are do and honestly in this video we're not super concerned

03:11.570 --> 03:15.620
with these top three layers application presentation in session.

03:15.620 --> 03:21.680
These are kind of like the things that are happening within my computer and we're not so worried about

03:21.710 --> 03:23.990
that from a networking perspective.

03:23.990 --> 03:30.970
So we don't spend a lot of time on application presentation and session last.

03:30.980 --> 03:34.080
So for these two layers let's just call the presentation layer.

03:34.100 --> 03:36.700
My operating system will call the session layer.

03:36.710 --> 03:40.060
This is how my operating system talks to other machines.

03:40.070 --> 03:47.000
And now we get into the layers that we're more concerned with when it comes to networking.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.470
The transport network datalink and physical Lares

03:53.390 --> 04:04.270
So the transport layer involves ports and protocols things like f t p s s h h TTP.

04:04.460 --> 04:12.680
Those are all different transport layer protocols and what they govern is how is my data actually move

04:12.680 --> 04:14.220
from point A to Point B.

04:14.300 --> 04:16.700
Is it going to be reliable.

04:16.760 --> 04:19.870
If so we're talking about TCAP.

04:20.100 --> 04:22.170
Is it going to be unreliable.

04:22.170 --> 04:29.040
If so we're talking about UDP and we have these different protocols that basically do things differently

04:29.380 --> 04:32.040
and different types of traffic have different needs.

04:32.220 --> 04:34.960
So for example let's talk about.

04:35.060 --> 04:37.730
And reliable type of traffic.

04:37.740 --> 04:47.160
Let's say we're streaming video through Netflix Well we don't need to guarantee the reliable delivery

04:47.340 --> 04:48.670
of that data.

04:48.990 --> 04:53.830
All right let's say that a packet is dropped or lost.

04:54.090 --> 05:00.330
Well we're not going to go back and retransmit that packet because at that point it's too late.

05:00.330 --> 05:00.540
Right.

05:00.540 --> 05:08.610
The time has already come and gone for that packet and so at this point we don't need reliable delivery

05:08.610 --> 05:09.550
of data.

05:09.840 --> 05:18.630
So we're going to go with an unreliable layer for protocol and that's suitable for certain types of

05:18.630 --> 05:19.100
data.

05:22.360 --> 05:29.920
However for other types of data that might not be suitable we may need to ensure that every last bit

05:29.920 --> 05:33.370
of data that gets transmitted is received.

05:33.370 --> 05:42.910
And that's where we're going to use TCAP the reliable delivery of data and TZP involves significantly

05:42.910 --> 05:51.630
more overhead with TZP the two nodes that are communicating with each other are going to use tools like

05:51.660 --> 06:00.340
checksums to ensure that everything that the sender has sent is actually received by the receiver.

06:01.790 --> 06:09.390
And so this involves more overhead and more verification and therefore it's a little bit less efficient.

06:09.890 --> 06:18.000
But there are certain protocols that we want to guarantee that level of delivery and we'll see this

06:18.000 --> 06:29.680
expressed in all sorts of different ports like S-sh poor 22 a.p port 23 there's a wide variety of well-defined

06:29.730 --> 06:35.340
port numbers and you can also utilize custom port numbers for your own applications.

06:43.490 --> 06:50.090
The next layer will take a look at is the network where this is layer 3 and this is the layer or things

06:50.090 --> 06:54.970
like IP addresses and routers reside.

06:55.170 --> 07:00.600
So every device on a network has a unique identifier called an IP address.

07:00.600 --> 07:06.220
And we may send packets to things like a default gateway which is commonly a router.

07:06.410 --> 07:13.880
And as we work our way through this course you'll learn a lot more about IP routing layer 3 traffic

07:13.970 --> 07:18.170
and the actual functions that a router performs.

07:18.170 --> 07:22.500
But that's what we're talking about when we talk about Layer 3 is IP addresses and routers

07:25.170 --> 07:32.930
layer 2 is our data link clear and that layer is commonly associated with ethernet.

07:33.130 --> 07:38.980
So why the data link where we're talking about things like ether net about our ethernet switches about

07:38.980 --> 07:47.620
protocols like ARP CTP and we're talking about our local area network and the ability to enter connected

07:47.620 --> 07:54.600
devices with a switch that are on the same network.

07:54.600 --> 08:02.720
Now the final layer the lowest layer on our website model is the physical for and this is the physical

08:02.810 --> 08:03.880
stuff.

08:03.900 --> 08:09.820
It's things like cables if you have like a microwave wireless transmitter.

08:09.830 --> 08:15.860
That's the physical Lehre you know if you have a fiber optic cable or if you just simply have an ethernet

08:15.860 --> 08:20.560
cord connecting your computer to a switch that's the physical layer.

08:20.930 --> 08:25.910
So if something happens at the physical there we're typically talking about like a cable that's been

08:25.910 --> 08:31.940
caught or some other kind of actual physical component failure.

08:31.940 --> 08:37.880
Those are the things that create issues at the physical layer.

08:38.000 --> 08:45.050
OK so now that we've defined the seven layers and given you a really basic understanding of what is

08:45.050 --> 08:51.590
occurring at each layer Let's talk about some of the failures and some of the terminology that is used

08:52.190 --> 08:58.550
to associate failures with the seven layers and we're going to work our way from the bottom up because

08:58.550 --> 09:00.650
if I was troubleshooting an actual network.

09:00.770 --> 09:02.170
That's what I would do.

09:02.170 --> 09:08.870
I mean if I have a network problem I'm going to start by eliminating the physical Lehre as a potential

09:08.870 --> 09:09.430
issue.

09:09.650 --> 09:15.080
And honestly more often than not that's where you're going to find the problem.

09:15.090 --> 09:22.390
So what sorts of problems can occur at the physical where well at the physical there we're talking about

09:22.390 --> 09:29.470
something physical happening like somebody has unplugged to the wrong cable or somebody has accidentally

09:29.470 --> 09:32.320
cut a cable that wasn't supposed to be cut.

09:32.440 --> 09:34.500
Or maybe we're talking about wireless.

09:34.540 --> 09:38.470
It's common to see things like interference or even with ethernet.

09:38.530 --> 09:41.140
That's why that cabling is shielded.

09:41.170 --> 09:48.140
Right because other sorts of electrical devices and things like that can interfere with our cables.

09:49.200 --> 09:56.590
So if we're having a Alair one problem that means something's wrong at a physical level.

10:00.090 --> 10:02.630
So what sort of failure can actually occur.

10:02.730 --> 10:06.580
Datalink where while we have a few listed here.

10:06.580 --> 10:08.290
And let's kind of work our way through them.

10:09.220 --> 10:18.030
Now in modern switches we will almost always have a VPN associated with a port on a switch.

10:18.060 --> 10:25.130
So you're going to plug a device into a switch and that device will be associated with a certain VPN.

10:25.450 --> 10:28.350
We're going to have a video on villans coming up shortly.

10:28.630 --> 10:30.910
But essentially here's how it works.

10:31.120 --> 10:38.470
If one virtual machine is in V land tan let's say and another virtual machine is in Vili's and 20 they

10:38.470 --> 10:42.270
won't be able to communicate with each other over layer 2.

10:42.760 --> 10:51.090
It's a way to kind of break my switch up into segments and make it almost feel like multiple switches.

10:51.110 --> 10:54.790
There are certain machines that we don't want to have them communicate over the switch.

10:54.790 --> 10:58.510
I'd like to force their traffic through a firewall or something like that.

10:58.600 --> 11:00.340
That's what we accomplish with a VPN.

11:00.430 --> 11:09.300
So if we improperly configured a VPN or if we've configured a port in the wrong the mode those are data

11:09.300 --> 11:16.260
link layer type issues we can also have broadcast traffic on Alair to network.

11:16.400 --> 11:23.920
The most common form of broadcast traffic is ARP and this is where one device is trying to discover

11:23.920 --> 11:26.040
the Mac address of another device.

11:26.860 --> 11:33.820
And if I have loops in my typology that's going to result in something called the broadcast storm where

11:33.820 --> 11:41.440
broadcast traffic just goes around and around and around infinitely from one switch to another until

11:41.470 --> 11:43.800
it brings our network to a screeching halt.

11:44.680 --> 11:52.240
We'll learn about spanning tree protocol in an upcoming video and that'll help us to ensure that these

11:52.240 --> 11:56.000
loops do not exist in our lair to network.

11:56.020 --> 11:59.700
So those are some layer to type of problems.

11:59.740 --> 11:59.940
Right.

12:00.160 --> 12:05.820
And just a quick reminder the address at Layer 2 is the MAC address.

12:05.830 --> 12:14.400
Now this MAC address or Media Access Control address is hard coded into our network interface cards.

12:14.440 --> 12:19.930
So whether we're talking about a virtual machine or a physical machine there is a unique MAC address

12:20.350 --> 12:23.020
hardcoded into that device.

12:24.680 --> 12:28.350
Now how about the network where what sorts of problems can occur there.

12:28.730 --> 12:32.280
Well the most common problem is a duplicate IP address.

12:32.330 --> 12:39.500
Maybe I've got two virtual machines or physical machines or whatever that are on the same network and

12:39.500 --> 12:42.860
have been configured with the identical IP address.

12:42.890 --> 12:44.360
That's not going to work.

12:44.420 --> 12:48.220
Every machine on a network has to have a unique identifier.

12:48.230 --> 12:50.200
The IP address has to be unique.

12:50.300 --> 12:57.680
And so if we have IP conflicts that's going to be a layer 3 problem or if we have a mis configured router

12:57.980 --> 13:05.140
maybe routing entries missing from our roundtable problems at the router level those are a layer of

13:05.140 --> 13:06.690
three issues.

13:11.520 --> 13:14.700
The next layer we'll talk about is the transport layer.

13:14.700 --> 13:19.770
And honestly you're probably not going to run into a whole lot of issues here right at the transport

13:19.770 --> 13:20.150
layer.

13:20.160 --> 13:27.030
We don't often see a whole lot of misconfiguration or problems that occur as a matter of fact I'm struggling

13:27.030 --> 13:32.460
to come up with a great example of a flair for problem that I've ever had to fix.

13:32.500 --> 13:41.100
It basically as a as a networking person you're not going to have to mess around a whole lot with layer

13:41.100 --> 13:41.740
4.

13:41.970 --> 13:46.860
And this kind of is the same for Lares 5 6 and 7 right.

13:46.860 --> 13:53.510
If you're a programmer if you're an application designer if you're in one of those roles then yeah.

13:53.520 --> 13:57.050
Lares 4 through seven are really important to you.

13:57.390 --> 14:05.050
But from our perspective as networking people we're very highly focused on layers 1 through 3.

14:05.070 --> 14:09.990
Those are the layers that are really critical from a networking perspective and they're very important

14:10.980 --> 14:14.390
to understand NSX and network virtualization as well.

14:14.490 --> 14:19.680
So that's the area that will focus from here on out moving forward in this class.
