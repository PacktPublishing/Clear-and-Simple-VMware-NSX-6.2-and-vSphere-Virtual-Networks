00:00.760 --> 00:06.690
In this video we'll take a look at some of the features that are supported by our virtual switches and

00:06.700 --> 00:13.330
we're going to walk through some features that are supported by the vees fair standards which And we'll

00:13.330 --> 00:18.640
also walk through some features that are not supported by the Vee's for standards which are only supported

00:19.180 --> 00:20.940
by the Vee's for distributed switch.

00:21.760 --> 00:24.370
And I'll point those out as we come to them.

00:24.580 --> 00:26.760
And this first line is a good example.

00:26.850 --> 00:35.590
We have two different discovery protocols Cisco discovery protocol or CVP and Linkletter discovery protocol

00:35.650 --> 00:43.680
or L-L DP and these are useful features that have been around for a long time on network hardware and

00:43.680 --> 00:48.880
they can be used to discover information about other connected network devices.

00:48.960 --> 00:57.360
So for example assume that this ESX host pictured here has a VSE standard switch and it's connected

00:57.360 --> 01:00.140
to a physical Cisco switch.

01:01.340 --> 01:09.710
We can configure Cisco discovery protocol or see DP on the standard virtual switch to allow it to discover

01:09.710 --> 01:13.210
some of the characteristics of the physical switch.

01:15.270 --> 01:20.850
Here's an example of some of the information that we'll be able to view within the Vee's for web client

01:21.090 --> 01:22.620
when CTP is enabled.

01:23.610 --> 01:30.840
Here we can see that this VM neck or physical adapter is connected to a Cisco physical switch that has

01:30.840 --> 01:37.010
the IP address of ten not one not one not one we can see what port that VM Nic is connected to.

01:37.200 --> 01:44.350
And we can even see the hardware platform and software version of the Cisco switch.

01:44.370 --> 01:49.660
Now that's what CGP does an LDP is basically the same thing.

01:49.890 --> 01:57.600
It's called link where discovery protocol now LDP is only supported on the VSE for distributed switch.

01:59.310 --> 02:06.930
And this is a vendor agnostic kind of standard discovery protocol that supports a number of different

02:06.930 --> 02:09.440
vendors.

02:09.490 --> 02:15.430
So here we see we have a Vee's for a distributed switch running on an ESX host with two VM next are

02:15.430 --> 02:22.170
physical adapters and those VM next are connected to a physical switch that supports Al.

02:22.750 --> 02:28.450
And so now from within the Vee's for web client we can view details about that physical switch such

02:28.450 --> 02:34.180
as the IP address the port number that are these very distributed switches plugged into the hardware

02:34.180 --> 02:38.470
platform and a variety of other information is presented as well.

02:40.380 --> 02:42.140
Now one final note.

02:42.930 --> 02:50.820
You want to check with your security policy prior to enabling CD PNL DP because this is going to be

02:50.820 --> 02:56.700
exposing some of the details of the physical network and it can also expose details about your virtual

02:56.700 --> 02:58.070
network as well.

02:58.500 --> 03:05.040
And so there is a possibility that this network information could be compromised and used to attack

03:05.040 --> 03:06.360
your network.

03:06.360 --> 03:12.120
So just make sure before you enable these features that its allowed based on your company's network

03:12.120 --> 03:13.080
Security Policy

03:16.340 --> 03:23.540
Network IO control can be used to enforce Chers limits and reservations on different types of network

03:23.540 --> 03:30.110
traffic and network IO control is only supported on the VSE fair distributed switch.

03:31.980 --> 03:39.270
So network control allows us to ensure that certain types of traffic will always be granted sufficient

03:39.300 --> 03:40.740
bandwidth.

03:40.740 --> 03:49.500
So for example in this diagram VM traffic is granted twice as many shares as I scuzzy traffic or Wii

03:49.500 --> 03:52.390
motion traffic.

03:52.390 --> 03:58.600
Now what does this mean on a normal day to day basis Lets say that we have plenty of physical bandwidth

03:58.600 --> 04:03.750
to go around well if thats the case the share structure means nothing.

04:05.030 --> 04:10.250
Shares are only enforced when there is a scarcity of resources.

04:11.390 --> 04:18.890
So if there is contention for bandwidth that means that my virtual machine traffic will effectively

04:18.890 --> 04:24.730
get twice as much bandwidth as Wii motion and I scuzzy.

04:24.970 --> 04:31.900
We can also configure things like limits or reservations with network I will control as well and we

04:31.900 --> 04:39.490
can also create network resource pools based on port groups to allow us to define priorities for different

04:39.490 --> 04:41.620
virtual machine port groups.

04:41.620 --> 04:45.950
Now the way I like to think of network IO control is sort of like a safety net.

04:46.150 --> 04:52.240
I'm not a big fan of configuring limits or reservations but I do like configuring shares.

04:52.780 --> 04:57.230
And the goal is that hopefully those shares will never take effect.

04:57.250 --> 05:03.340
Hopefully we'll always have plenty of available bandwidth and we won't need to utilize that share structure.

05:03.580 --> 05:10.870
But should a situation arise where we have a scarcity of bandwidth network i o control will ensure that

05:10.870 --> 05:13.380
the appropriate traffic is prioritized

05:18.050 --> 05:22.910
traffic filtering and tagging is supported by the VSD fair distributed switch.

05:24.070 --> 05:31.300
So for example we could create a filtering policy for incoming traffic from a certain IP address range

05:31.300 --> 05:36.340
or maybe on a certain TCAP port.

05:36.540 --> 05:43.830
And as that traffic flows into the vees fair distributed switch and it matches that criteria that we've

05:43.830 --> 05:52.410
identified we can take different actions on that traffic like for example simply dropping it or we could

05:52.410 --> 06:01.740
create a marking policy to assign class of service or DCP tags to packets coming from a specified IP

06:01.740 --> 06:04.540
address.

06:04.540 --> 06:11.650
So here comes a packet from Vergine machine one and maybe matches a traffic marking policy that we've

06:11.650 --> 06:13.740
created in the Vee's for distributed switch.

06:14.630 --> 06:22.280
Based on that it will be a sign quality of service headers and as that packet traverses the physical

06:22.280 --> 06:30.660
network the physical network will respect the quality of service values and ensure that that traffic

06:30.660 --> 06:32.230
is handled appropriately.

06:34.030 --> 06:40.370
And so filtering and tagging basically gives us two functions the filtering function allows us to basically

06:40.370 --> 06:47.390
establish an access list where certain traffic can be either permitted or denied the tagging capability

06:47.780 --> 06:52.450
allows us to create quality of service policies and append.

06:52.460 --> 06:58.870
Q All else matters to traffic as it leaves the virtual switch bound for the physical network.

07:05.350 --> 07:11.340
Network health check is a feature that's only available on the VSE fair distributed switch.

07:11.380 --> 07:18.190
The purpose of network health check is to ensure that the virtual switch and the physical switch have

07:18.190 --> 07:20.290
been configured in a compatible manner.

07:21.230 --> 07:28.420
So in this example we can see that the VSE for distributed switch has an empty view of 9000.

07:28.430 --> 07:31.650
The physical switch hasn't MTU of 15:24.

07:31.940 --> 07:39.050
So these empty values are mismatched and that means that as frames leave the virtual switch and hit

07:39.050 --> 07:40.940
the physical switch.

07:40.940 --> 07:45.560
They may need to be fragmented and reassembled by that physical switch.

07:46.640 --> 07:53.570
And this can create some serious problems because the CPP usage of that physical switch can be extremely

07:53.570 --> 07:59.160
high if it's doing fragmentation and reassembly.

07:59.250 --> 08:05.700
We can also see that on the VSE for distributed switch we've configured IP hash Nic teaming which requires

08:05.730 --> 08:09.120
a port channel configuration and the physical switch.

08:09.120 --> 08:15.980
However the physical switches and configure that way and we can also see a Vesely and mismatch as well.

08:17.260 --> 08:24.820
The purpose of network health check is to expose these inconsistencies so that we can easily identify

08:25.270 --> 08:26.140
and fix them.

08:27.740 --> 08:35.720
Now one side note about this from a security perspective it's a best practice to leave network health

08:35.720 --> 08:43.500
check disabled and only enable it when you're trying to validate that something's been configured correctly.

08:44.220 --> 08:48.070
So the best practice is to leave this disabled unless we're actually using it

08:51.980 --> 08:58.750
net flow reports traffic information to a centralized collector right.

08:58.780 --> 09:04.130
Net flows kind of like the kid that tells on all his friends and the net flow collector is like the

09:04.130 --> 09:04.970
mom.

09:05.530 --> 09:06.930
So let's walk through this.

09:06.940 --> 09:12.370
And number one this is only available via a distributed switch.

09:12.370 --> 09:18.780
So here we see a couple of virtual machines called 10.0 $1.1 11 and 10 not one not one not 12.

09:18.820 --> 09:21.020
Those are the IP addresses of the victims.

09:21.160 --> 09:27.710
And then up towards the top of the screen in purple we see a net flow collector on the far right.

09:27.790 --> 09:35.390
We see some external machine with the IP address of 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 12.

09:35.470 --> 09:41.550
So let's say that my VM generates some traffic that's bound for that external physical machine.

09:41.650 --> 09:47.620
And here it goes it flows out through the virtual switch over the physical switch and towards that physical

09:47.620 --> 09:54.000
host well what's going to happen at that point is the vees for distributed switch is going to generate

09:54.000 --> 09:55.650
something called the traffic flow.

09:56.010 --> 10:02.370
That's basically going to identify the source and destination the TCAP poor of that traffic and some

10:02.370 --> 10:08.760
other fairly limited information about that traffic and all of our traffic is going to result in these

10:08.760 --> 10:15.330
flows that are constantly being sent to the net flow collector and the net flow collector will include

10:15.330 --> 10:21.680
some reporting capabilities so that we can see which virtual machines are generating the most traffic.

10:21.690 --> 10:24.550
What ports is the most traffic going over.

10:24.570 --> 10:28.670
Is there a certain type of traffic that spikes at a certain time of day.

10:28.800 --> 10:35.010
Well now we've got all of these traffic records that are stored in a centralized collector and we can

10:35.010 --> 10:37.290
report on any of this criteria that we want to

10:44.490 --> 10:44.800
port.

10:44.800 --> 10:50.000
Mirroring is another feature that's only available in the vees fair distributed switch.

10:50.170 --> 10:57.550
It can be used to send a copy of all of the traffic on one port to another port.

10:57.560 --> 11:03.110
So for example here we see on the left two virtual machines tend not one not one but 11 and 10 that

11:03.110 --> 11:11.880
one not one time 12 we can set up a port mirroring session so that any traffic that comes in bound for

11:11.880 --> 11:21.210
the port that we want to monitor will be automatically mirrored to some other poor maybe on the second

11:21.210 --> 11:22.820
V.M. towards the bottom.

11:22.860 --> 11:29.730
We want to run a sniffer and analyze all of the traffic that's flowing to the top virtual machine where

11:29.910 --> 11:35.020
we could set up what's called a distributed port mirroring session to accomplish that.

11:35.250 --> 11:41.460
And that's exactly what we see here in our animation and distributed port mirroring session means any

11:41.460 --> 11:50.590
traffic for one specific virtual port that we identify will be automatically mirrored to another port.

11:50.590 --> 11:56.080
Now we could also set up other types of Port mirroring sessions for example.

11:56.080 --> 12:01.660
Let's talk about some of the other types of marrying sessions and just understand that these might be

12:01.660 --> 12:04.000
represented on the VCP exam.

12:05.840 --> 12:13.740
A remote mirroring source will watch one of our distributed virtual ports and instead of mirroring to

12:13.740 --> 12:18.780
another virtual port it will mirror outward of our uplinks.

12:18.920 --> 12:21.430
That's a remote mirroring source.

12:21.770 --> 12:29.750
A remote mirroring destination port mirroring session will monitor an entire V LAN and sent all of that

12:29.750 --> 12:32.610
traffic to a distributed virtual port.

12:34.430 --> 12:43.850
Host level rollbacks occur when a change is made that breaks in ESX I hostes connection with the center.

12:44.020 --> 12:51.970
So every network change that disconnects a host also triggers a rollback and the change that caused

12:51.970 --> 12:56.070
the issue was undone and the configuration reverts back to the way it was.

12:56.380 --> 13:02.170
So for example let's assume that an administrator changes the IP address of the management VM kernel

13:02.170 --> 13:02.890
port.

13:03.310 --> 13:08.920
And so therefore the ESX host loses connectivity to the center.

13:09.060 --> 13:15.090
At this point the host is now disconnected but host level rollback will kick in and the change will

13:15.090 --> 13:17.870
be automatically reverted.

13:17.870 --> 13:26.610
We also have a feature called distributed switch rollback distributed switch rollbacks occur when it

13:26.610 --> 13:34.850
changes made to the distributed switch that breaks connectivity changes that can trigger this rollback

13:34.850 --> 13:38.670
include changing the empty view on a distributed switch.

13:38.840 --> 13:43.850
Choosing an incompatible Nic teaming method or choosing an incorrect VPN.

13:43.860 --> 13:51.310
So for example let's assume that we change the V lab on the VSE for a distributed switch to 20.

13:51.390 --> 13:57.750
But the physical switch is configured for VLAN 10.

13:57.780 --> 14:04.820
This results in my ESX I hostes being disconnected from the V Center network for management.

14:04.830 --> 14:06.880
Now if this happens you have a couple of options.

14:06.900 --> 14:11.440
You can manually fix the problem in the physical switch restoring connectivity.

14:11.790 --> 14:17.650
Or you can restore the configuration of the Vee's for a distributed switch from backup as well.

14:20.680 --> 14:27.950
So in reveal we learned about discovery protocols in this lesson including CTP and L-O.

14:28.250 --> 14:33.830
And we learned that CVP is Cisco's specific and it's actually supported by the vees for standard switch

14:33.920 --> 14:41.910
or the VSE for a distributed switch LDP is only available on the vees fair distributed switch and this

14:41.910 --> 14:49.370
is also the case for net flow net flows for a distributed switch feature that uses a centralized collector

14:50.400 --> 14:56.820
to aggregate traffic details and produce reports.

14:56.930 --> 15:02.960
We learned about traffic filtering and marking and how it can be used to create access lists or also

15:02.960 --> 15:07.010
to tag certain types of traffic with quality of service values.

15:08.710 --> 15:15.070
We learned about network IO control and how it can be used to ensure that our most important traffic

15:15.250 --> 15:18.580
always gets sufficient bandwidth on the physical network.

15:19.640 --> 15:25.910
We talked about a few different port mirroring session types and how they can be used to send a copy

15:26.390 --> 15:32.950
of traffic on a virtual port to some other virtual port so that traffic can be monitored.

15:34.730 --> 15:40.370
And then finally we learned about the rollback feature how it can automatically revert damaging network

15:40.370 --> 15:43.010
changes and restore the center connectivity.
