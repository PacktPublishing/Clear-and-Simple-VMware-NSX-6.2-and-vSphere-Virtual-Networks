00:01.170 --> 00:08.130
In this video I'll explain later to broadcast traffic and how it impacts the performance of either a

00:08.130 --> 00:10.410
physical or virtual switch.

00:10.970 --> 00:18.830
Now there can be a variety of different reasons that a virtual machine or physical machine generates

00:18.830 --> 00:20.720
a layer to broadcast.

00:20.720 --> 00:25.800
The most common reason is an ARP request and I'm going to do a video on that as well.

00:27.410 --> 00:32.690
But let's just focus on what actually happens when a layer to broadcast is generated.

00:33.800 --> 00:37.280
Now with ethernet layer 2 or IP.

00:37.310 --> 00:42.030
LEHRER 3 there are special addresses called broadcast addresses.

00:42.440 --> 00:50.990
And basically if you send a frame to the broadcast address within that frame is going to be flooded

00:51.230 --> 00:52.820
to every single port.

00:52.940 --> 00:57.780
That's part of that layer to network.

00:57.800 --> 01:03.020
So let's take a look at our diagram here and I've got a bunch of virtual machines those little white

01:03.020 --> 01:04.340
blocks up at the top.

01:04.340 --> 01:06.680
Those represent virtual or physical machines.

01:06.680 --> 01:08.510
Doesn't really matter.

01:08.510 --> 01:15.150
And one of those virtual machines or physical machines sends a very true broadcast to the physical switch.

01:15.990 --> 01:21.160
Along with the physical switches going to do is it is going to receive that frame.

01:21.160 --> 01:30.040
Take a look at the destination MAC and the destination MAC address is a layer to broadcast the dress.

01:30.180 --> 01:37.900
So it will then for that frame out every single pore on that switch and every single machine will receive

01:37.900 --> 01:39.870
a copy right.

01:40.100 --> 01:46.550
This is kind of like I always equate this to let's say or shopping or you're at the grocery store or

01:46.550 --> 01:53.020
some department store and somebody comes over the P.A. system and says Please pay attention everybody

01:53.800 --> 01:54.820
the following.

01:54.850 --> 02:00.220
License plate numbers left their lights on in the parking lot and everybody kind of stops and just waits

02:00.220 --> 02:02.980
for a moment and listens to hear if it's their car.

02:02.980 --> 02:08.670
Well it's kind of like what a broadcast is you're sending something out to everybody.

02:09.060 --> 02:12.810
But really only one person cares about it.

02:12.810 --> 02:13.390
Right.

02:13.740 --> 02:16.070
And that's kind of what our requests are like.

02:16.140 --> 02:18.660
And that's what a lot of broadcast traffic is like.

02:18.660 --> 02:26.280
So ideally we'd like to avoid this broadcast traffic as much as we possibly can especially our requests.

02:28.750 --> 02:35.410
Now let's say for example that our switch is actually connected to another switch as well.

02:35.460 --> 02:37.780
It may be either a physical or virtual switch.

02:37.780 --> 02:41.380
Again it doesn't really matter is connected to another switch.

02:41.850 --> 02:47.410
And via some sort of interest much like maybe there's an ethernet connection or a trunk Kapoor that

02:47.410 --> 02:50.010
connects these two switches together.

02:51.720 --> 02:58.130
Well in that scenario the broadcast will actually flow from one switch to another.

02:58.140 --> 03:02.620
This is all part of a layer to network.

03:02.710 --> 03:09.800
So if my broadcast is originated by a machine connected to the virtual switch on top it will also be

03:09.800 --> 03:11.420
passed with the switch on bottom.

03:11.630 --> 03:23.860
And again every device connected to that switch will receive a copy of that letter to broadcast.

03:23.860 --> 03:27.480
Now let's make one more change to our typology here.

03:27.640 --> 03:31.190
Let's add a router and one more switch.

03:32.260 --> 03:35.640
And this which is connected to the network via our router.

03:35.680 --> 03:41.670
So there's a router in between the two switches on the left and the switch on the right.

03:41.690 --> 03:46.960
What do you suppose happens to our lair to broadcast in this scenario.

03:48.070 --> 03:51.460
Well the broadcast will be passed to that router.

03:51.520 --> 03:58.510
The router will receive that Lero to broadcast because the router is also connected to that Lerato network.

03:58.670 --> 04:00.400
However that's the end of it.

04:00.700 --> 04:09.040
The router does not ever pass where to broadcast traffic out to other network segments.

04:09.040 --> 04:16.560
So that's kind of the limiting factor in our physical or virtual that work to those Lehre to broadcasters

04:16.570 --> 04:18.520
when they hit a router they stop their.
