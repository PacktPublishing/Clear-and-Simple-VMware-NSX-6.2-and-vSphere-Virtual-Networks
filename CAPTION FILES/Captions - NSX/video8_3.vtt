00:00.410 --> 00:10.580
In this video we'll look at the network and guest introspection services provided by service composer.

00:10.710 --> 00:18.360
So would if we want to integrate some third party solution that does guest introspection like for example

00:18.870 --> 00:27.450
let's say that we have a third party virus scanning appliance and it can scan virtual machines and detect

00:27.480 --> 00:36.740
viruses and if it does detect a virus on a virtual machine what it can do is it can tag that VM.

00:36.780 --> 00:45.290
So here we see the virtual machine called app 3 has been tagged with this virus tag my anti-virus solution

00:45.290 --> 00:55.780
has found a virus on the VM and has tagged we can create a security group called virus group let's say.

00:55.920 --> 01:01.350
And that security group can have a dynamic inclusion criteria that says.

01:01.460 --> 01:09.850
And even ATMs that have this virus tag should be included in this security group.

01:09.890 --> 01:14.860
So the virus group security group includes all via SMS with the virus tag.

01:15.050 --> 01:17.490
That's a dynamic inclusion criteria.

01:18.710 --> 01:28.660
And we can apply a highly restrictive security policy to that security group basically saying we're

01:28.660 --> 01:35.350
going to allow virus group to communicate with the anti virus solution and we're going to allow the

01:35.350 --> 01:41.440
anti virus solution to communicate with the virus group and anything else from that virus group is going

01:41.440 --> 01:43.010
to be blocked.

01:43.030 --> 01:49.120
So now we've created this level of isolation that is really strong.

01:49.410 --> 01:49.630
Right.

01:49.630 --> 01:57.520
My virus scanning solution detected a virus tagged to that VM based on that tag that VM was dropped

01:57.520 --> 02:04.780
into a new security group where it was completely isolated from everything except for the virus scanning

02:04.780 --> 02:05.630
solution.

02:06.790 --> 02:15.100
And now that virus can be resolved and when it is the virus scanning solution will remove that tag and

02:15.100 --> 02:18.390
the virtual machine will be removed from this virus.

02:18.390 --> 02:27.250
Group Security Group that's a great example of how guest introspection can protect our environment by

02:27.370 --> 02:34.240
isolating a virtual machine with some sort of security risk.

02:34.250 --> 02:35.790
Let's look at another example.

02:36.620 --> 02:41.210
Here we've got some sort of sensitive data on a virtual machine.

02:41.240 --> 02:47.370
And we've deployed the V.M. where data security solution.

02:47.500 --> 02:51.950
So this works very similar to the anti-virus example that we just saw.

02:52.150 --> 02:56.390
Only instead of looking for viruses it's looking for sensitive data.

02:56.540 --> 03:01.200
This is very useful if you're subject to compliance regulations.

03:01.210 --> 03:05.740
So let's say for example you're subject to PCI compliance.

03:05.880 --> 03:11.870
So it's very important that there's not credit card data where there shouldn't be credit card data.

03:13.530 --> 03:22.050
And let's say that a credit card number is found on the virtual machine at 3 well VM where data security

03:22.050 --> 03:26.560
will tag that virtual machine with a security tag.

03:26.560 --> 03:29.470
In this case we're calling the security tags CC.

03:30.100 --> 03:37.630
And we can then create a security group with dynamic inclusion that says any virtual machines with the

03:37.630 --> 03:46.350
CC tag should be dropped into a security group called credit card and will allow the data loss prevention

03:46.350 --> 03:50.880
system to communicate with that credit card security group.

03:51.480 --> 03:57.150
But if that credit card security group wants to reach out and connect with anything else or if anything

03:57.150 --> 03:59.050
else is trying to connect to it.

03:59.430 --> 04:02.350
It's going to be quarantined it's going to be blocked.

04:02.400 --> 04:10.070
So now we don't have to worry about this sensitive data potentially leaving our network as soon as VM

04:10.070 --> 04:17.040
or data security detects that sensitive data that virtual machine is automatically isolated.

04:17.090 --> 04:19.850
Think about what this will do from a compliance perspective.

04:19.850 --> 04:21.810
It's really powerful stuff.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.070
And that's the purpose of V.M. we're data security.

04:26.070 --> 04:32.810
It's a powerful compliance tool that will automatically tag VAMC and includes a lot of pre-built compliance

04:32.810 --> 04:33.920
templates.

04:34.080 --> 04:39.170
About 80 different compliance templates including Hippe PCI and many others.

04:39.570 --> 04:43.470
And it doesn't require any software on the virtual machine to be installed.

04:43.800 --> 04:51.650
You'll enable it using surface composer where we can dynamically remove tags if the sensitive data is

04:51.650 --> 04:52.860
no longer present.

04:52.880 --> 04:59.930
So a virtual machine will be automatically on quarantined when that sensitive data is removed.

05:01.230 --> 05:07.110
Now we've looked at the guest introspection capabilities of service composer.

05:07.110 --> 05:10.040
Now let's take a moment to look at network introspection.

05:11.860 --> 05:17.170
So we have some service that's running out in our network and the service doesn't need access to the

05:17.170 --> 05:19.300
guest operating system.

05:19.310 --> 05:26.050
So for example let's say we're running an intrusion prevention system and we've got a virtual machine

05:26.050 --> 05:36.250
called app 1 and the app one VM is part of some security group that we have specified needs to be inspected

05:36.460 --> 05:40.670
by this network intrusion prevention service.

05:40.680 --> 05:45.580
So now a packet comes into our network that's destined for this virtual machine.

05:46.800 --> 05:53.370
And when that traffic hits the distributed firewall kernel module it will be redirected.

05:54.270 --> 06:02.010
To the intrusion prevention system and assuming no malicious traffic is found the packet is then passed

06:02.010 --> 06:06.430
along to the virtual machine.

06:06.440 --> 06:14.030
You could also configure the security group as the traffic source if you want to analyze outbound traffic

06:14.570 --> 06:18.070
coming out of our VM.

06:18.160 --> 06:24.400
So just know that any of these third party services must be registered with NSX manager in order for

06:24.820 --> 06:25.690
them to work.

06:25.720 --> 06:29.020
And that process varies a little bit with each different vendor.

06:29.470 --> 06:37.340
But the key point that I want to make sure we get across here is that unlike guest introspection this

06:37.340 --> 06:40.910
is not examining the guest operating system in any way.

06:40.910 --> 06:50.940
Our policy here is redirecting traffic to some service that we've registered using service composer.

06:50.960 --> 06:57.890
So if my virtual machine sends or receives some traffic that matches this policy that traffic is going

06:57.890 --> 07:05.480
to be relayed to the intrusion prevention system a virtual appliance so that it can scan that information

07:05.810 --> 07:09.880
prior to passing that traffic along.

07:09.910 --> 07:17.200
So in review we've seen here how service composer can automatically apply security policies and how

07:17.200 --> 07:23.740
we can include our virtual machines in a security group using either a dynamic or static.

07:25.510 --> 07:31.750
We've also seen that we can utilize third party tools and we can integrate them to provide protection

07:32.350 --> 07:37.290
either using guest introspection or network introspection.

07:37.310 --> 07:42.710
Our guest introspection tools are going to examine the guest operating system of our virtual machines

07:42.710 --> 07:52.990
for things like sensitive data or viruses or we can use service composer to redirect traffic to a network

07:53.080 --> 07:56.920
introspection tool such as an intrusion prevention system.

07:59.460 --> 08:05.790
Finally when you create a new security policy you can choose a parent policy that it will inherit rules

08:05.790 --> 08:06.520
from.

08:06.930 --> 08:13.590
So you could create multiple security policies that have parent policies and they can inherit those

08:13.590 --> 08:15.560
rules from the parent policy as well.
