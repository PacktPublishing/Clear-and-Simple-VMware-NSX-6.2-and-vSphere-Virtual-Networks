00:00.240 --> 00:06.900
In this video I'll explain the concept of our requests and we'll look at how and our request is handled

00:06.900 --> 00:09.680
by an Ethernet switch.

00:09.700 --> 00:15.100
So here we see a pretty simple diagram of two devices connected to anything that switch.

00:15.340 --> 00:21.430
This could be virtual machines they could be physical machines but there are some sort of device that's

00:21.430 --> 00:23.070
connected to an Ethernet switch.

00:23.880 --> 00:30.790
For the sake of this example let's assume that their Windows machines and let's assume that the machine

00:30.790 --> 00:40.000
on the left with MAC address a and IP address tend not one not want to wants to communicate with the

00:40.000 --> 00:41.100
machine on the right.

00:41.830 --> 00:43.360
Let's say it wants to send a ping to it.

00:45.380 --> 00:52.430
Now with that in the source or virtual machine there's going to be an ARP table and when an ARP table

00:52.430 --> 01:01.260
is essentially a list of mappings that map IP addresses to MAC addresses because if my source VM wants

01:01.260 --> 01:08.590
to communicate with this destination VM that's going to happen over there to network this traffic is

01:08.590 --> 01:10.820
not being sent to the default gateway.

01:10.840 --> 01:12.590
It's not being sent to a router.

01:13.060 --> 01:19.920
It's going to be direct communication over that which between these virtual machines.

01:19.940 --> 01:27.560
So in order to accomplish that the source VM needs to know the MAC address of the destination virtual

01:27.560 --> 01:28.110
machine.

01:30.620 --> 01:36.650
So let's say I go into my Windows operating system on my source VM and I type in the command paying

01:36.650 --> 01:47.090
$10 Wannop 1.3 and my all table in the guest operating system of this source virtual machine does not

01:47.210 --> 01:51.760
currently have an R table entry for that IP address.

01:52.850 --> 02:00.190
That means at this point the sending VM doesn't know the MAC address of the receiving what will happen

02:00.190 --> 02:07.570
at this point is the source virtual machine will generate and ARP request and in ARP request is a layer

02:07.570 --> 02:09.950
to broadcast.

02:10.010 --> 02:16.840
So the source VM will send out this broadcast basically saying who has the IP address at hand not one

02:16.840 --> 02:22.130
not one not three it will send that broadcast to the physical or virtual switch.

02:22.130 --> 02:29.480
And at that point the switch will flooded out every single port that the switch is connected to every

02:29.480 --> 02:35.630
port on that layer 2 domain and a bunch of machines are going to see this request that don't need to

02:35.630 --> 02:36.150
see it.

02:36.160 --> 02:37.540
All right it's a broadcast.

02:37.670 --> 02:39.240
So it's going to hit everything.

02:40.300 --> 02:44.230
Until it eventually hits the appropriate machine.

02:45.060 --> 02:48.690
And this machine is going to say Yeah ten not one not one not three.

02:48.690 --> 02:50.170
That's me.

02:50.220 --> 02:52.880
Let me generate an output response.

02:53.980 --> 03:01.360
And it will then send an ARP response to the source machine to provide it with that IP.

03:01.360 --> 03:04.460
Tim Alcatraz mapping.

03:04.720 --> 03:10.520
So then in the future if the source machine generates some traffic destined for $10 one not one not

03:10.520 --> 03:22.710
three that can be unicast traffic that goes directly to that destination virtual machine.

03:22.740 --> 03:30.720
So it's in our best interests to minimize this our traffic as much as we possibly can because it's broadcast

03:30.720 --> 03:33.880
traffic and it generates a lot of overhead on our network.

03:34.710 --> 03:45.030
When we get into NSX We'll take a look at how NSX suppresses these ARP requests and kind of minimizes

03:45.030 --> 03:50.790
the number of broadcasts that are required on Alair to network.

03:50.790 --> 03:59.270
So in summary and our request is simply a request by virtue machine to discover the destination MAC.

03:59.400 --> 04:04.950
It already knows the destination IP it's trying to communicate with something that's on that same network

04:04.950 --> 04:11.540
that same layer to network so issues in ARP request to discover the destination MAC.
