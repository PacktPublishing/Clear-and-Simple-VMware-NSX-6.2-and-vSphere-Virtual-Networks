00:00.440 --> 00:05.260
In this video I'll cover replication modes for broadcast.

00:05.490 --> 00:13.190
Unknown unicast and multicast traffic or as we call it bumm traffic.

00:13.220 --> 00:21.350
So these replication modes are used to replicate broadcast unknown unicast and multicast traffic to

00:21.350 --> 00:25.390
different ESX hosts and this is special traffic.

00:25.610 --> 00:33.050
For example we have broadcast traffic broadcast traffic is sent to all machines on a layer 2 segment

00:33.260 --> 00:37.480
I had a good example of a broadcast our request.

00:37.660 --> 00:43.550
Now unknown unicast traffic results from a virtual switch or a physical switch.

00:43.630 --> 00:48.150
Not knowing the MAC address of the device that is trying to connect to.

00:48.310 --> 00:51.620
That's how switches learned to MAC addresses.

00:51.790 --> 00:58.240
And we also have multicast traffic which is traffic that's sent to selective destinations.

00:58.440 --> 01:04.230
If you're not familiar with these traffic types I'd definitely recommend going back and watching the

01:04.440 --> 01:09.180
introductory video I do on bump traffic and it's also part of this course.

01:10.750 --> 01:19.300
So as this multiday destination traffic is generated it needs to be replicated to all of the Vieuxtemps

01:20.230 --> 01:27.520
of the duplicable hosts that are connected to those logical switches where this multi destination traffic

01:27.520 --> 01:29.240
is coming from.

01:29.380 --> 01:37.480
And at times these v taps might potentially be on different layer three networks known as VX LAN segments

01:37.510 --> 01:39.650
or VTX segments.

01:39.790 --> 01:48.380
Maybe there's a router between a couple of my hosts and the result is that I have taps that are on different

01:48.380 --> 01:50.630
networks.

01:50.740 --> 01:53.800
So let's start by breaking down this diagram a little bit.

01:53.800 --> 01:55.290
Here we see two virtual machines.

01:55.300 --> 02:03.740
VM one and VM file and each virtual machine is on an ESX host it's connected to a logical switch.

02:04.680 --> 02:07.170
And there's a tap on each host as well.

02:07.170 --> 02:15.240
So if any traffic needs to go from VM 1 to VM 5 for example it's going to flow through this V tap get

02:15.240 --> 02:22.200
via actually an encapsulated flow over the underlying network get decapitated by the receiving the tap

02:22.770 --> 02:29.260
before it ever reaches virtual machine five.

02:29.270 --> 02:31.270
So let's walk through this process.

02:31.280 --> 02:40.220
Let's say that VM one wants to ping VM five and let's assume that VM ones are table doesn't have an

02:40.220 --> 02:42.150
entry for VM 5.

02:43.230 --> 02:48.400
So VM one knows the IP address VM five but not the Mac address.

02:49.210 --> 02:53.190
So what happens in this case well in this case.

02:53.190 --> 03:00.520
VM one is going to generate an ARP request and an our request is a layer to broadcast.

03:00.820 --> 03:06.880
So we're talking about broadcast traffic now and that's one of our three types of traffic that we talked

03:06.880 --> 03:09.810
about in our bumm traffic right broadcast.

03:09.910 --> 03:11.740
Unknown unicast and multicast

03:14.380 --> 03:18.420
So one VM one generates that broadcast.

03:18.430 --> 03:27.690
It's a layer to broadcast and it needs to be received by everything connected to this logical switch.

03:27.690 --> 03:32.050
Now there could be 50 Reems on each host that need to get this broadcast.

03:32.070 --> 03:37.090
There could be 50 hosts that need to get this broadcast.

03:37.140 --> 03:46.150
Wouldn't it be nice if our virtual machine could just send one copy of that broadcast that would arrive

03:46.150 --> 03:55.840
at the tap and would be multicast it or broadcast it to the appropriate receiving the taps that are

03:55.840 --> 03:57.890
part of that logical switch.

04:00.670 --> 04:04.000
Well that's exactly what our replication modes are going to do.

04:04.330 --> 04:10.810
So we're going to look at three different ways that this layer to broadcast or unknown unicast or multicast

04:10.810 --> 04:19.300
traffic can get replicated to multiple receiving taps so that this layer to traffic can traverse even

04:19.300 --> 04:23.100
a layer 3 physical network.

04:23.170 --> 04:33.090
Let's start by identifying this concept called a proxy tap the different replication methods that we're

04:33.090 --> 04:40.710
going to look at will all leverage VA Axton to move this bum traffic from host to host and at times

04:40.830 --> 04:45.580
something called the proxy tap will be used to accomplish this.

04:45.580 --> 04:51.550
So for example let's say that virtual machine one generates in our request and that our request hits

04:51.550 --> 04:53.280
the tap.

04:53.290 --> 05:01.900
Now the job of the tap is to ensure that that ARP request is received by every single machine connected

05:01.900 --> 05:05.760
to a logical switch via five thousand one.

05:05.820 --> 05:13.150
So what the tap will do is it'll encapsulate that ARP request inside of a VX LAN hatter and it will

05:13.150 --> 05:20.620
transmit it not only to the taps on the local segment but in this case it's also going to send it to

05:20.620 --> 05:28.180
a special tap in our remote tap segment called the proxy we tap.

05:28.310 --> 05:34.450
It's easy to get that broadcast moved around within our own local segment.

05:34.590 --> 05:40.930
But we also need to get it across this router and do something called the proxy tap.

05:40.940 --> 05:43.130
Now what is the role of this proxy V-Tech

05:46.950 --> 05:56.460
when the proxy tap receives that our request it will replicate that frame locally with it and own local

05:56.490 --> 05:57.750
VX LAN segment.

05:57.750 --> 06:06.340
So across this physical switch the proxy taps job is to replicate that frame locally.

06:06.390 --> 06:11.760
And what this does is it reduces some of the overhead on the source.

06:11.770 --> 06:18.690
VTEC right the source VI type is responsible for essentially setting that bumm traffic to all the taps

06:18.690 --> 06:25.740
in its own local segment but it doesn't need to send a unique copy of that traffic to every V-Tech in

06:25.740 --> 06:27.300
every remote segment.

06:27.360 --> 06:31.870
The proxy tap is going to offload some of that work.

06:31.880 --> 06:34.760
So that's the concept of a proxy VTEC.

06:35.030 --> 06:47.470
And you'll see exactly how that's used as we start to dig into some of these replication what.

06:47.650 --> 06:56.950
Another thing I want to talk about is multicast so and OS X handles replication of bum traffic in three

06:56.950 --> 07:02.590
different modes multicast hybrid or unicast.

07:02.760 --> 07:10.570
In this first example we'll look at multicast replication mode so multicast is kind of like a pay per

07:10.570 --> 07:11.610
view TV show.

07:11.770 --> 07:12.250
Right.

07:12.250 --> 07:21.250
It's sent out once and everybody who is subscribed to it can watch it multicast makes sense because

07:21.250 --> 07:25.060
the source only needs to send that data once.

07:25.390 --> 07:34.830
And how many subscribers can receive a copy if I want to configure multicast replication mode.

07:34.910 --> 07:41.800
I have to be comfortable with configuring multicast that my physical network I'm going to have to configure

07:41.830 --> 07:46.320
IGMP and IGMP snooping on the physical network.

07:46.360 --> 07:49.310
I'll have to create a multicast address as well.

07:50.850 --> 07:59.960
But the benefit of this replication mode is it creates the lowest overhead and RV types.

07:59.970 --> 08:04.210
OK so for example let's follow this through and see exactly how it works.

08:04.270 --> 08:12.480
Let's say that virtual machine one generates an ARB request or that our request will hit the tap and

08:12.480 --> 08:19.850
the tap will for that broadcast to the multicast address that we have configured.

08:19.910 --> 08:21.800
It's an address on this physical switch

08:24.580 --> 08:33.580
and the physical switch itself will then handle replicating a copy of that data to every pore that is

08:33.580 --> 08:37.360
joined to the multicast.

08:37.360 --> 08:43.270
So for example in this case there's a port that's connected to this V tap that's joined the multicast

08:43.870 --> 08:49.310
and there's also a port connected to my router that has joined the multicast as well.

08:49.600 --> 08:57.180
So it's the physical switches job to ensure that everything that needs to get that traffic is actually

08:57.180 --> 09:01.490
going to get it.

09:01.570 --> 09:08.770
Now the router will use something called protocol independent multicast to forward that multicast into

09:08.770 --> 09:19.290
the remote VX LAN segment where the physical switch can then handle replicating that traffic using IGMP.

09:19.530 --> 09:26.410
There is no such thing as a proxy tap in this multicast replication mode.

09:26.420 --> 09:30.110
We don't use a proxy via tap.

09:30.130 --> 09:36.850
Now real quick while we're on this topic let's talk about why people like to use this multicast replication

09:36.850 --> 09:37.280
mode.

09:38.720 --> 09:46.010
The primary benefit is the fact that our source VI tap only needs to send that traffic once right.

09:46.010 --> 09:50.840
In other modes the source we type may have to send that traffic many times or it might have to send

09:50.840 --> 09:56.270
a copy to all the local Vieuxtemps it might need to send a copy to a proxy tap.

09:56.390 --> 09:56.630
Right.

09:56.630 --> 09:59.340
In other modes it's less efficient.

10:00.180 --> 10:01.550
And multicast mode.

10:01.700 --> 10:09.240
There's very little overhead on that source VTEC it only has to send one copy of that bump traffic and

10:09.240 --> 10:15.480
then its job is done and it's up to the physical network to ensure that all of the appropriate taps

10:15.870 --> 10:17.100
receive that data.

10:20.160 --> 10:25.860
Now hybrid mode is a little bit different in hybrid mode.

10:25.860 --> 10:32.880
We're still going to have to configure IGMP snooping on the physical network.

10:33.120 --> 10:41.040
We're still going to have to configure multicast in our switches but we're not going to have to configure

10:41.040 --> 10:42.950
multicast in our router.

10:43.080 --> 10:43.280
Right.

10:43.290 --> 10:47.780
That's the big difference between hybrid mode and multicast mode.

10:47.820 --> 10:54.780
We need layer to multicast but not layer 3 because we're going to use something called the proxy V-Tech.

10:54.800 --> 10:57.140
So let's break down how this mode works.

10:58.600 --> 11:00.760
Let's say that virtual machine 1.

11:00.820 --> 11:03.130
Generate some sort of broadcast traffic.

11:03.130 --> 11:11.660
Again it's an arm request and the ARP hits this V-Amp the V-Tech will forward that broadcast traffic

11:11.810 --> 11:21.970
to the physical switch on the multicast address and everything that is joined that multicast will receive

11:21.970 --> 11:23.580
a copy of that data.

11:25.730 --> 11:33.570
Now in this situation this is purely Alair to multicast and I haven't configured anything in my router

11:33.900 --> 11:37.180
to accommodate this multicast traffic.

11:37.560 --> 11:40.480
So that's where my multicast is going to stop

11:48.400 --> 11:53.630
and so my source of type actually has a little bit more work to do in this scenario.

11:53.680 --> 12:01.010
It's going to send a unicast copy of that packet to our proxy VTEC.

12:01.280 --> 12:06.800
And in this case the proxy we type is called that M tap when you want to make sure you have these names

12:06.800 --> 12:16.110
straight if you're going to take the VCP exam so the M tap is a special type of proxy tap that's used

12:16.110 --> 12:17.000
with hybrid boat

12:19.830 --> 12:27.720
and the job of the tap will be to replicate that broadcast traffic locally within its VTX segment.

12:28.910 --> 12:35.990
So when the proxy tap receives that unicast it'll send it out to the multicast address of the physical

12:35.990 --> 12:43.580
switch and the physical switch will then handle replicating that traffic to all of the taps in that

12:43.640 --> 12:44.950
local segment.

12:49.810 --> 12:54.430
So a really quick review let's just talk through this process one more time.

12:54.430 --> 13:02.640
V.M. one generates a broadcast the broadcast hits the V tap the tap is going to do two things.

13:02.640 --> 13:08.850
Number one it's going to send that broadcast traffic to the multicast address of the physical switch

13:09.690 --> 13:13.660
so that it can be replicated within its own local segment.

13:13.890 --> 13:21.600
And it's also going to send a unicast copy of that traffic to the proxy via tap which will be responsible

13:21.600 --> 13:26.080
for replicating it locally within that remote VX landside and

13:29.280 --> 13:32.320
all right now let's walk through our final replication mode.

13:32.340 --> 13:39.180
This mode is called unicast and the big benefit of unicast replication mode is you don't have to configure

13:39.390 --> 13:42.450
any multicast settings in the physical network at all.

13:45.140 --> 13:48.080
So in unicast mode here's what's going to happen.

13:49.200 --> 13:56.160
Again assume VM one issue some sort of broadcast traffic or unknown unicast or multicast traffic.

13:56.370 --> 14:07.720
The VTech receives that traffic and it's the job of the tap to then unicast a copy of that packet to

14:07.720 --> 14:11.840
the taps within its local segment.

14:11.850 --> 14:20.290
It's also going to you and the cast a copy of it to the proxy tap on any remote segments.

14:20.330 --> 14:27.520
And what I mean by that is here we see we have some VI taps on the 10.0 1.1 network and we have some

14:27.540 --> 14:31.380
the taps in a remote network.

14:31.490 --> 14:38.060
So the job of the source via tap will be to send a copy of that traffic to one of the taps on this remote

14:38.060 --> 14:48.230
network which will then use unicast to send a copy of that traffic to all of the local V taps in that

14:48.230 --> 14:52.320
VX LAN segment.

14:52.660 --> 15:00.310
So again really important for the VCP is to keep straight the names of these proxy taps and an unicast

15:00.310 --> 15:02.920
mode the proxy type is called the tap

15:09.730 --> 15:18.040
so in review we're going to use replication modes to get bomb traffic moved between VX X segments to

15:18.040 --> 15:25.790
ensure that this bump traffic is received by all of our taps if we choose to utilize multicast mode.

15:25.840 --> 15:31.990
We're going to have to configure multicast on the physical network not only on the switches but on the

15:31.990 --> 15:33.500
routers as well.

15:33.870 --> 15:36.030
Multicast mode is very efficient though.

15:36.430 --> 15:42.740
So we has that benefit hybrid mode is kind of like half way in between.

15:42.840 --> 15:43.060
Right.

15:43.060 --> 15:51.970
It's going to within the local tap segment it's going to use Layer to multicast but to reach those remote

15:52.060 --> 15:56.210
VX LAN segments it's going to generate a unicast.

15:56.260 --> 16:02.390
So it's kind of like halfway between multicast and unicast right using multicast for some traffic use

16:02.550 --> 16:11.310
is unicast for other traffic unicast mode does not require any multicast configuration in the physical

16:11.310 --> 16:12.500
network.

16:12.750 --> 16:20.250
It will send a copy of all bumm traffic to all of the local Vieuxtemps and it'll also send a copy of

16:20.250 --> 16:29.690
that traffic to what's called a U tap which is a proxy tap existing in every other remote VX LAN segment.
