In this video I'll explain the SSL VPN plus feature of the NSX such SSL VPN Plus is one of the three

00:09.060 --> 00:19.720
VPN options that the NSX that supports and the SSL VPN plus service is intended to be a Remote Access

00:19.720 --> 00:26.320
solution it has different access modes that it supports and different use cases that we'll take a look

00:26.320 --> 00:27.150
at as well.

00:29.360 --> 00:35.920
Well let's take a look at an example of the SSL VPN plus use case.

00:35.980 --> 00:42.670
So here we see and ESX I host VSX 0 1 and it's got some virtual machines in it that are connected to

00:42.670 --> 00:43.770
a logical switch.

00:44.720 --> 00:47.380
And we've also got an NSX edge deployed.

00:47.540 --> 00:52.430
And we're going to need that for the SSL VPN plus service.

00:52.520 --> 00:58.850
So the NSX edge has one network connection that's connected to the internal logical switch.

00:59.150 --> 01:03.880
And this is our local internal network our virtual machines reside on.

01:03.920 --> 01:07.510
So we want to make sure that this network is kept secure.

01:07.510 --> 01:16.360
Right we don't want to give direct access to this handout 1.1 11 network out to the Internet.

01:16.430 --> 01:23.810
So what we can then do if we want to accommodate remote users is we can set up and SSL VPN plus solution

01:24.200 --> 01:31.360
where we can launch a client on a laptop or on some other home PC type device.

01:32.100 --> 01:41.540
And we can establish a SSL VPN session between the laptop and the ANOSIKE such and all of that traffic

01:41.870 --> 01:47.280
over the untrusted network in this case the internet will be encrypted.

01:47.390 --> 01:53.600
Now once the Windows laptop or whatever kind of quiet device we happen to be using establishes that

01:53.690 --> 02:02.850
SSL VPN tunnel connection it can then access the inside network and securely connect to these virtual

02:02.850 --> 02:09.200
machines that are on my hidden internal network.

02:09.290 --> 02:17.660
So that's the point of SSL VPN Plus is to allow secure remote access to an internal network.

02:17.700 --> 02:24.000
So let's take a few moments to review some of the different modes and features that are supported by

02:24.000 --> 02:28.740
SSL VPN Plus we have two different tunnel modes.

02:28.760 --> 02:31.670
We have full tunnel mode or split tunnel mode.

02:33.480 --> 02:40.380
And with full tunnel mode all traffic generated by our client device is going to be sent through the

02:40.380 --> 02:41.450
VPN.

02:41.490 --> 02:48.600
So even regular old internet type traffic will flow over the VPN through the private network and then

02:48.600 --> 02:49.870
out to the Internet.

02:50.160 --> 02:52.910
Now split tunnel mode is a little bit different.

02:53.130 --> 02:59.010
Split tunnel mode allows us to send some traffic directly out over the Internet connection of the client

02:59.010 --> 03:04.030
device and traffic that needs to flow over the VPN.

03:04.080 --> 03:10.870
Well so this is a somewhat less secure option because if I'm forcing all of my internet traffic over

03:10.870 --> 03:16.170
the VPN I can force it through my own internal security solutions.

03:18.090 --> 03:22.670
SSL VPN Plus does not support any mobile clients currently.

03:22.890 --> 03:28.030
It does support active directory radius and eldership authentication.

03:28.680 --> 03:34.380
And when you configure as is how VPN Plus you can actually create a client installation package.

03:34.470 --> 03:43.080
This can be used to create a distributable thick client for either Windows Mac or Linux that our users

03:43.440 --> 03:47.160
can then run their client devices.

03:47.190 --> 03:55.020
We can also use a web browser based SSL VPN plus client but that's only supported for software as a

03:55.020 --> 03:56.580
service applications.

03:57.540 --> 04:04.950
Finally it does have a built in compression as well which can improve performance over a slower performing

04:04.950 --> 04:06.240
wide area networks.
