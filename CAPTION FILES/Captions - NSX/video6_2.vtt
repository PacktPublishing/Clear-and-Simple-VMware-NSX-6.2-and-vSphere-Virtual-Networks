00:00.650 --> 00:06.630
In this video I'll introduce you to some of the fundamental concepts of the NSX edge and we're going

00:06.630 --> 00:12.960
to be spending a lot of time in this course working our way through the NSX edge NSX edge is kind of

00:12.960 --> 00:18.900
like the Swiss Army knife of NSX and that it does so many different things.

00:19.020 --> 00:22.550
So we're going to be spending a lot of time focusing on the edge.

00:23.040 --> 00:30.510
And one of the primary functions of the NSX edge is going to be around or it's going to act as our north

00:30.600 --> 00:33.000
south router.

00:33.070 --> 00:35.330
So what do I mean by North-South.

00:35.770 --> 00:42.190
Well essentially the NSX are just going to be our egress point or if traffic needs to get to some sort

00:42.190 --> 00:52.100
of external network outside of our NSX domain it's going to flow over and add sex edge and we can use

00:52.280 --> 00:59.070
OSPF BGP or static routes to build the routing table for the NSX.

00:59.300 --> 01:04.880
And we'll take a look at all those different protocols and kind of what the benefits and disadvantages

01:05.030 --> 01:06.150
of each are.

01:08.830 --> 01:12.780
The NSX edge can also act as our perimeter firewall.

01:14.830 --> 01:22.180
So because of the placement of the NSX edge it makes a great perimeter firewall to block malicious traffic

01:22.930 --> 01:25.480
as it's coming into the NSX domain.

01:25.480 --> 01:29.490
Now this doesn't mean that it's the perimeter firewall for your data center.

01:29.710 --> 01:35.220
Right you're still going to need a physical firewall at the edge of your data center.

01:36.190 --> 01:41.600
But this is an additional added firewall at the border of the NSX domain.

01:44.850 --> 01:53.820
The NSX edge can also act as a load balancer it can be utilized to spread traffic out across a group

01:53.820 --> 01:56.850
of virtual machines that serve a similar purpose.

01:58.840 --> 02:06.430
We can also enable different kinds of VPN on the NSX including a layer 3 eyepiece like VPN Allaire to

02:06.430 --> 02:13.010
VPN or even a remote access solution called the SSL VPN.

02:13.230 --> 02:17.860
And then finally the NSX supports DHP and DNS relay as well.

02:20.200 --> 02:27.140
So we want to think of the NSX edge as the border between NSX and the external physical network.

02:28.020 --> 02:29.200
Think of it like this.

02:29.250 --> 02:38.640
Let's say you have an internal network that interconnects all of your ESX host thats called our underlying

02:38.640 --> 02:46.370
network and we see that at the bottom of the screen here the underlay provides connectivity within the

02:46.370 --> 02:47.650
NSX domain.

02:49.440 --> 02:55.260
It provides connectivity across all of these ESX hosts that are part of my NSX domain.

02:57.330 --> 03:04.650
Now if I need to go outside this east west routing domain thats where the NSX edge comes in.

03:05.770 --> 03:10.460
Maybe theres physical servers in my environment or I need to connect to the Internet.

03:10.570 --> 03:12.270
Thats where the edge comes in.

03:14.910 --> 03:22.320
So let's walk through this diagram and differentiate between east west and north south routing within

03:22.320 --> 03:23.790
NSX.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.080
And this diagram has a lot going on.

03:26.220 --> 03:29.150
So lets take a moment to just review it quickly.

03:29.220 --> 03:39.470
We see two ESX I hosts ESX 0 1 and 0 2 and I've got a couple of logical switches created we have logical

03:39.470 --> 03:47.980
switch the 95000 to and I've got one virtual machine connected to that logical switch.

03:47.990 --> 03:55.190
I've also got a logical switch called the transit logical switch and you can see that the logical switch

03:55.190 --> 04:02.920
is connected to my distributed logical router and it's also connected to the NSX edge.

04:03.070 --> 04:09.880
Right so this is kind of a special purpose logical switch that's going to give us connectivity to the

04:09.880 --> 04:10.810
NSX atch

04:14.290 --> 04:20.640
and we can see here that the agist connected to an external router probably a physical router and we

04:20.640 --> 04:27.930
can see at the bottom we have the taps on each of our ESX hosts that provide the VX LAN encapsulation

04:28.320 --> 04:32.960
and decaff solution functions.

04:32.990 --> 04:41.400
So now let's assume that VM one generates some sort of traffic some kind of traffic that's destined

04:41.400 --> 04:44.040
for something outside of our routing domain.

04:44.250 --> 04:49.030
So maybe somebody logged into VM one and typed and trayner tests.

04:49.440 --> 04:57.610
So now this traffic is bound for some external network.

04:57.650 --> 05:05.600
So here comes this packet and it's going to flow onto the logical switch and hit the default gateway

05:05.780 --> 05:07.940
for that virtual machine.

05:08.130 --> 05:13.890
And the default gateway for the VM is the distributed logical router.

05:13.920 --> 05:17.150
Now the DLR has a routing table.

05:17.370 --> 05:25.470
The dealer knows that if it wants to reach the 10.0 1.1 network it needs to go out a VX LAN lyfe that's

05:25.470 --> 05:32.290
connected to that network and the DLR probably also has a routing table entry that says for everything

05:32.320 --> 05:44.410
else for all external traffic routed out this interface connected to this transit network.

05:44.410 --> 05:48.480
So at this point the job of the distributed logical router is done.

05:49.490 --> 05:52.000
But there's still more routing that needs to happen.

05:52.180 --> 06:00.930
Our east west routing is complete so the NSX average has an interface on this transit network just like

06:00.930 --> 06:04.280
the DLR does.

06:04.390 --> 06:12.810
And this is the destination MAC that the distributed logical router has forwarded this packet to when

06:13.120 --> 06:19.750
the DLR received that packet and analyzed the destination and determined that the destination was out

06:19.810 --> 06:25.780
here in the external network it forward it towards the MAC address of the NSX.

06:27.800 --> 06:30.960
Out onto the x Lanne five thousand three

06:33.770 --> 06:39.610
right well now this frame still needs to get from host ESX 0 1 2 6 0 2.

06:39.950 --> 06:45.980
So at this point the frame will be encapsulated within a VAXen hatter and will flow over my underlying

06:45.980 --> 06:50.030
network and they get from Host 1 to host to

06:55.610 --> 07:03.150
heresie traversing the underlying network arriving on VNA five thousand three at the destination host.

07:03.650 --> 07:07.400
And that's the logical switch that the NSX edge is connected to.

07:07.400 --> 07:14.690
So now finally our packet can arrive at the NSX edge and get routed out to the external network in the

07:14.690 --> 07:16.800
end like such has its own routing table.

07:18.110 --> 07:23.750
And it knows to get to any external networks it has a certain interface that's an uplink interface out

07:23.750 --> 07:24.890
to the physical world.

07:25.890 --> 07:31.410
So little about that packet towards the external network where the Internet is and it can get the train

07:31.410 --> 07:35.970
or test dot com that we.

07:35.980 --> 07:41.370
So now we've seen North South vs. east west routing right.

07:41.380 --> 07:47.940
They're routing tables of the DLR and of the NSX edge are very different.

07:48.110 --> 07:55.160
If we want to route to some external network anything out of our NSX domain that's called North-South

07:56.380 --> 07:58.760
and that's where the NSX comes in.

07:59.260 --> 08:05.530
But if we're simply routing among virtual machines connected to different logical switches or even virtual

08:05.530 --> 08:12.710
machines connected to a distributed port group that the DLR is connected to that's east west routing

08:12.860 --> 08:22.240
and that's most efficiently handled by the distributed logical router.

08:22.320 --> 08:26.330
So the NSX can come in four different form factors.

08:26.430 --> 08:28.500
It's a virtual appliance.

08:28.500 --> 08:32.070
And when you're deploying the NSX that you can choose what size you want to make it.

08:32.240 --> 08:39.660
Now you can deploy a compact NSX edge which has one virtual CPO and 512 megabytes of memory.

08:39.660 --> 08:42.470
Now that's simply what the virtual machine is allocated.

08:42.480 --> 08:47.580
It doesn't mean that it's going to necessarily use all those resources but that's what it's going to

08:47.580 --> 08:49.010
be configured for.

08:49.230 --> 08:55.230
And we've got the large form factor which has an extra virtual CPO and 1 gig of memory.

08:55.350 --> 09:02.370
The quad Larch which has four virtual Seip use and a gig of memory and the extra large which has a virtual

09:02.370 --> 09:11.030
spews use and 8 gigs of memory and once you deploy the NSX adj you can change the size later on if you

09:11.030 --> 09:12.800
want to.

09:13.000 --> 09:18.000
But that process involves basically you're replacing the edge gateway.

09:18.040 --> 09:21.120
You don't need to rebuild the configuration or anything like that.

09:21.370 --> 09:27.710
But there is an outage involved if you want to change the form factor of the NSX Sache.

09:27.730 --> 09:33.360
It essentially migrates the configuration to a new virtual appliance.

09:33.400 --> 09:37.360
So just be aware that whatever you choose you're not necessarily stuck with.

09:37.660 --> 09:41.230
But if you want to get to a different form factor it's going to be service impacting

09:43.970 --> 09:49.790
and you'll choose the appropriate NSX at form factor based on the number of features that you're utilizing

09:50.180 --> 09:52.970
and the number of connections that you expect.

09:52.970 --> 09:58.640
And as we kind of go through the next few lessons we'll talk about a lot of these features and I'll

09:58.640 --> 10:04.550
point out some of the features that are more resource intensive that may justify a larger form factor

10:04.550 --> 10:07.380
for the NSX Hach.

10:07.570 --> 10:12.700
So as time goes on those decisions will probably be made a little bit more clear to you as to what form

10:12.700 --> 10:15.100
factor makes sense for your environment.

10:17.990 --> 10:24.390
Interview the NSX edge is our Swiss Army knife or it's the Swiss Army knife of NSX providing a router

10:24.960 --> 10:35.700
firewall load balancer IP secte VPN solution Lehre to VPN solution SSL VPN solution and a DHC P and

10:35.700 --> 10:37.300
DNS relay.

10:37.350 --> 10:43.020
We're going to do lessons on just about all of these features as we work our way through this course.

10:44.340 --> 10:51.200
We also saw how the NSX edge acts as the boundary between the NSX and external network.

10:51.210 --> 10:57.860
This means that the NSX is going to be performing our North-South routing routing between the NSX edge

10:57.870 --> 11:00.100
domain and the external network.
