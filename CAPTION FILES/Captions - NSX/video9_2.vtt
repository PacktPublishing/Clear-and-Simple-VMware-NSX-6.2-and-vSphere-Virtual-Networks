00:01.460 --> 00:10.330
It this video will take an in-depth look at Cross center NSX architecture will cover the following topics.

00:10.350 --> 00:16.010
We'll look at how universal objects can be used in cross recentre NSX deployments.

00:16.050 --> 00:23.170
We'll look at how the NSX manager and NSX controller clusters are affected when we set up Cross center

00:23.200 --> 00:32.310
NSX and we'll also talk about how egressed traffic reaches external networks Solan cross the center

00:32.400 --> 00:33.780
NSX deployments.

00:33.810 --> 00:41.880
They're still going to be one NSX manager hervé center Scherrer and each NSX manager will have a role

00:41.880 --> 00:49.320
assigned one NSX manager will be designated as the primary NSX manager.

00:49.320 --> 00:58.820
This is the only instance that actually has NSX controllers deployed and all of our universal objects

00:58.910 --> 01:04.260
are going to be managed by that primary and Hasek's manager.

01:04.290 --> 01:07.490
We can also have a secondary NSX manager.

01:07.530 --> 01:15.680
These are any NSX manager instances that are added after the primary has been established.

01:15.730 --> 01:24.400
The secondary NSX manager instances can not modify global objects they'll have read only access to global

01:24.400 --> 01:33.490
objects a transit NSX manager instances one you won't see a whole lot of but assume you have a primary

01:33.540 --> 01:36.760
NSX manager that you want to change to a standalone.

01:37.190 --> 01:45.590
During that process it's going to be designated as a transit and X manager and then finally we have

01:45.590 --> 01:47.200
a stand alone and unsexed manager.

01:47.210 --> 01:57.860
This is simply any NSX manager or instance that's not part of a cross V center and ASX deployment.

01:57.890 --> 02:04.940
All right so let's take a look at multiple active production center servers with cross vse and her NSX.

02:04.950 --> 02:12.750
So on the left hand side we see one V Center instance with our primary NSX manager and on the right

02:12.750 --> 02:19.140
hand side we see another V center server with our secondary NSX manager.

02:21.000 --> 02:29.030
And we see a universal controller cluster that is deployed with the primary and insect's manager.

02:30.460 --> 02:38.290
The secondary NSX manager does not have a controller kuasa and there's a synchronization service that

02:38.290 --> 02:42.710
runs between the NSX manager instances.

02:42.870 --> 02:50.340
So all management of universal objects like my universal logical switch or my universal distributed

02:50.340 --> 02:57.200
logical router all of the management of those universal objects is done.

02:57.240 --> 03:05.130
The primary NSX manager and the changes that are made there are synchronized to all of the secondary

03:05.280 --> 03:08.440
instances.

03:08.500 --> 03:17.900
So let's take a closer look at the primary NSX manager and how synchronizes with the secondary instances

03:19.560 --> 03:26.750
while the primary NSX manager is going to have what we call the universal controller cluster.

03:27.000 --> 03:34.170
So one of the key aspects of the NSX manager configuration in this environment is there is this synchronization

03:34.170 --> 03:40.750
service that runs between the primary NSX manager and the secondary NSX manager.

03:40.980 --> 03:48.900
In all of our configuration changes are going to be applied in this primary NSX manager but we have

03:48.900 --> 03:56.550
to think about the possibility that that primary site could fail so the secondary NSX manager needs

03:56.550 --> 04:04.190
to be kept up to date so the secondary NSX manager will have read only access to all of these universal

04:04.190 --> 04:10.910
objects and it will be synchronized with the primary and ex-manager but the primary is where those changes

04:10.910 --> 04:12.140
are actually made.

04:13.430 --> 04:22.690
The primary NSX manager is also the only NSX manager that has a universal controller cluster and the

04:22.700 --> 04:28.310
universal controller cluster is pretty similar to what we've seen with the controller cluster so far

04:29.180 --> 04:32.720
there are still three NSX control and Oulds per quarter.

04:33.260 --> 04:42.690
But it only exists with the primary NSX manager and since so if you're registering an existing NSX manager

04:42.840 --> 04:51.820
as a secondary You need to be sure to remove the NSX controllers from the secondary first.

04:52.040 --> 04:57.280
The logical switches that we create can be either local or universal.

04:57.310 --> 05:05.570
The Pentagon the transport zone that they're assigned to and this applies to logical switches and DLR

05:05.560 --> 05:08.830
is created at the secondary NSX sites as well.

05:10.630 --> 05:13.090
How about the distributed firewall.

05:13.120 --> 05:21.020
So the primary NSX manager is where all of our universal firewall rules are created and managed.

05:21.400 --> 05:27.960
And these rules are synchronized across all of the NSX manager instances using the synchronization service

05:29.930 --> 05:32.780
these universal firewall rules are fairly limited.

05:32.900 --> 05:37.640
Primarily you're going to manage firewall rules using IP sets.

05:37.640 --> 05:46.810
You can also create rules based on Max sets or universal firewall security groups the universal firewall

05:46.810 --> 05:54.610
rules ensure that as virtual machines move from one v center to another that their security posture

05:54.610 --> 05:55.880
is still enforced.

05:57.940 --> 06:03.490
So we can Wii motion a VM from the site on the left to the side on the right and the firewall rules

06:03.490 --> 06:04.650
come right along with it.

06:04.840 --> 06:12.640
As long as they are universal firewall rules and you'll see those universal rules are displayed in their

06:12.640 --> 06:22.120
own section of the firewall management interface for at Sachs.

06:22.160 --> 06:29.740
Now one of the features of the universal logical router is this feature called local egress and this

06:29.740 --> 06:37.400
is used to ensure that traffic bound for an external network uses the best possible route.

06:37.410 --> 06:44.100
So in the scenario we see here we have two v centers servers in the same physical location and we have

06:44.100 --> 06:49.840
an NSX sedge that's running on the Quester the left.

06:49.940 --> 06:57.260
This is the only egress point and this is a fairly simple scenario because we don't need seperate routes

06:57.260 --> 06:59.540
for each V Center instance.

06:59.540 --> 07:08.400
So in this case the local egress feature should be left disabled and will have a universal logical routing

07:08.400 --> 07:16.080
control VM that will be used to exchange dynamic routing updates between the distributed logical router

07:16.740 --> 07:18.290
and the NSX.

07:18.600 --> 07:25.890
And any routes that are learned are pushed to the kernel modules on the hosts by the universal controller

07:25.890 --> 07:28.420
cluster.

07:28.510 --> 07:36.520
So the distributed logical router works pretty much exactly the same as we've always seen in a cross

07:36.520 --> 07:44.170
V Center and OS X deployment where we have local egressed disabled and in the universal control VM establishes

07:44.170 --> 07:51.700
those routing adjacencies and it pushes all of the routing table updates to the hosts through the universal

07:51.700 --> 07:53.450
controller cluster.

07:53.470 --> 07:58.660
And because we only have one egress point all of these hosts are going to match up they're all going

07:58.660 --> 07:59.740
to have the same routing table

08:03.610 --> 08:07.260
now what if we have equal cost multipath enabled.

08:07.540 --> 08:14.160
And I have an NSX edge deployed on two different hosts.

08:14.290 --> 08:21.630
So in this diagram we have two physical routers that we want to use for egress.

08:21.820 --> 08:25.300
The two blue circles represent different physical routers.

08:25.300 --> 08:33.040
They're both the same site so there's still no need to configure local egress right edge one is managed

08:33.040 --> 08:41.840
by the primary NSX manager edge two is managed by the secondary but there's still only a single universal

08:41.840 --> 08:47.990
control VM and it establishes adjacencies with both of these NSX.

08:48.930 --> 08:55.770
And we can then use equal cost multipath thing to evenly distribute traffic for all virtual machines

08:55.770 --> 08:58.350
across both of the edge gateways.

08:58.350 --> 09:05.610
Now one of those educate ways fails or one of the physical routers fails for example the routing protocol

09:05.610 --> 09:11.860
will be used to ensure that that traffic gets redirected over the surviving path.

09:13.790 --> 09:18.090
So with a single site configuration things really don't change a lot.

09:18.470 --> 09:27.140
Right Things are pretty similar to the way that they were without cross V Center Allisons.

09:27.170 --> 09:33.060
So how do we deploy crossfeed center and sect's in a single location.

09:34.140 --> 09:42.730
Well first off we would create a universal transport zone a universal transport zone that spans all

09:42.730 --> 09:51.580
of my coster's and we could then create our universal logical switches.

09:51.720 --> 09:57.990
And so once we have our universal transport zone defined we can create a logical switch we can associate

09:57.990 --> 10:00.030
it with that universal transport zone.

10:01.460 --> 10:10.860
And one of our universal logical switches will be a transit switch that is used to connect to the distributed

10:10.860 --> 10:15.480
logical router to the NSX etch.

10:15.490 --> 10:23.810
So next comes the universal distributed logical router along with the universal control via.

10:23.940 --> 10:29.210
There is no need to configure local ers in this case because we're still at a single location.

10:30.230 --> 10:39.080
The next step would be to configure the universal logical router to connect to the transit network and

10:39.200 --> 10:44.270
we also want it to connect to our logical switches that our VM connect to as well.

10:45.280 --> 10:51.280
And then finally we'll deploy the added services Gateway will connect that to the transit logical switches.

10:51.300 --> 10:54.950
Well and also to the external network.

10:54.960 --> 11:01.350
So now if our VM are connecting to the universal logical switch they have access to their default gateway

11:01.620 --> 11:07.920
which is the universal distributor logical router and the universal distributor logical router is connected

11:07.920 --> 11:15.520
to the transit switch which gives it access to the NSX edge and through the NSX had access to the Internet.

11:17.930 --> 11:21.080
Now things get a little bit more complicated.

11:22.280 --> 11:30.100
If we want to deploy cross V center NSX in separate physical locations.

11:30.310 --> 11:35.310
So in this case we're going to use a feature called local ers.

11:35.320 --> 11:42.250
This is a feature of the universal distributed logical router and this feature is used to ensure that

11:42.250 --> 11:47.170
any traffic bound for an external network takes the best possible route.

11:48.180 --> 11:55.350
So in this scenario we have two different v center servers in two different physical locations and at

11:55.350 --> 12:05.160
each site we have an NSX edge deployed and for each site that NSX is the optimal egress point for our

12:05.160 --> 12:06.760
traffic for that location.

12:08.190 --> 12:15.100
So in this case we need to enable the local egress feature on the universal logical router.

12:16.160 --> 12:20.090
And we'll have control via SMS in both locations.

12:21.940 --> 12:31.710
Each site will have a locale ID assigned to it so that site specific routing tables can be used so this

12:31.710 --> 12:37.680
means that each of our locations is going to have a unique routing table with the best possible routes

12:37.680 --> 12:39.600
for that particular location.

12:40.380 --> 12:49.600
And each site also has its own Transat logical switches with uplinks that connect to the NSX sketch.

12:49.610 --> 12:55.610
So now my universal distributed logical router has two different sets of uplinks one set of uplinks

12:55.670 --> 13:03.700
for each location and any routes learned involving the NSX agit site.

13:04.260 --> 13:12.440
Those routes are kept local desiré and the routes learn for site B are kept local to site B each site

13:12.440 --> 13:17.630
has its own control VM that's in charge of building the dynamic routing table.

13:17.630 --> 13:26.680
So my secondary control VM will establish an adjacency with edge to my primary logical routing control

13:26.680 --> 13:32.890
via well-established and adjacency with Edgemont.

13:33.090 --> 13:40.460
Let's talk our way through upgrading an existing deployment to cross V Center and ASX.

13:40.710 --> 13:49.060
The number one step is to ensure that your NSX manager instances are both on Version 6 not to notice

13:49.060 --> 13:50.390
at the bottom here.

13:50.440 --> 13:55.780
We have overlapping VNA eyes Vionnet five thousand one is deployed.

13:55.930 --> 13:58.250
Both of these locations.

13:58.470 --> 14:05.400
So we need to make sure that we migrate those two different V.N. eyes so that we don't have conflicts

14:05.490 --> 14:06.980
between the two sites.

14:07.140 --> 14:16.250
When we Nabl cross V Center and that's we can then promote one of our NSX manager instances to the primary

14:16.430 --> 14:24.890
NSX manager and the controller cluster associated with that primary NSX manager instance will become

14:24.890 --> 14:33.750
the universal controller cluster the NSX controller cluster that's associated with the secondary NSX

14:33.750 --> 14:42.260
manager should be deleted and the NSX manager site B must be registered to the primary NSX manager.

14:42.330 --> 14:51.140
At which point it becomes a secondary NSX manager instance and now all of the logical switches and the

14:51.140 --> 14:56.410
DL RS must be associated with the universal controller.

14:56.510 --> 15:02.000
At this point we can start to create these universal objects like universal distributed logical routers

15:02.120 --> 15:05.270
and universal logical switches.

15:05.270 --> 15:10.820
Now a few key considerations that we want to talk about prior to actually doing this.

15:10.820 --> 15:19.950
It's only supported on VSE fair six or later any service composer generated firewall rules are not supported

15:20.040 --> 15:22.370
on universal objects.

15:22.440 --> 15:27.960
Our local firewall rules do not come with virtual machines that are moved between the center instances

15:28.890 --> 15:37.150
and our universe alogical switches do not support Lehre to bridging our local logical switches can only

15:37.150 --> 15:43.690
be connected to a local distributed logical router and universal logical switches can only be connected

15:43.690 --> 15:46.680
to a universal logical router.

15:46.730 --> 15:50.370
So let's talk a little bit about what happens if a failure occurs.

15:50.420 --> 15:58.520
What happens if my primary NSX manager instance fails or if the universal controller cluster or universal

15:58.520 --> 16:04.860
control VM fail what we need to remember that these components are in the management plane and in the

16:04.860 --> 16:11.850
control plane and a failure does not impact production traffic.

16:12.010 --> 16:20.470
The recommended recovery process is to try to get this primary NSX manager instance back up and running.

16:20.470 --> 16:28.330
But if that's not possible the secondary NSX manager instance can be promoted to a primary and a sex

16:28.330 --> 16:29.560
manager.

16:29.560 --> 16:35.110
And in that case we would also need to deploy a new universal controller cluster.

16:35.110 --> 16:40.290
So ideally you'd want to recover the existing primary NSX manager.

16:40.300 --> 16:46.150
But if you have a complete site loss or something like that you can promote the secondary NSX manager

16:46.630 --> 16:52.960
and it will have the identical configuration because it's been synchronizing with the primary NSX manager

16:53.020 --> 16:54.070
all along.

16:56.800 --> 17:04.820
In review we can use Crosby center NSX to create universal objects like universal logical switches universal

17:04.820 --> 17:12.840
firewall rules and universal distributed logical routers that span multiple V Center inventory's.

17:12.980 --> 17:19.190
It allows the same Lehre to network to be present at different locations which can really help with

17:19.190 --> 17:20.420
disaster recovery.
