In this video I'll explain how sex and VX Liane can affect network scalability.

00:09.290 --> 00:16.330
So here we see a group of VSX high hosts and just kind of picture these like their racks of hosts.

00:16.460 --> 00:23.180
So I moldable racks of hosts and let's say I'm using the VST for distributed switch so I don't have

00:23.190 --> 00:24.960
NSX in this scenario.

00:26.260 --> 00:34.240
Well as I add more and more racks of hosts I have to add more and more switches and my Alair to network

00:34.660 --> 00:43.720
has to spam all of these VSX I hosts then in this scenario we don't really have that many hosts.

00:43.720 --> 00:50.890
So the impact really isn't that severe but what we want to bear in mind when we're talking about distributed

00:50.890 --> 00:51.700
switches.

00:51.880 --> 00:55.580
They cannot traverse a layer 3 physical network.

00:55.870 --> 01:04.460
So I'm going to have to have all of these switches or connected via Lehre to with each other.

01:04.550 --> 01:10.460
And again in a fairly small environment like this the impact isn't that substantial.

01:11.130 --> 01:14.960
But what happens when my environment begins to grow.

01:18.040 --> 01:25.480
So I've just added a bunch of hosts and as I add more and more ESX I hosts what happens is my Llyr to

01:25.480 --> 01:28.160
network gets bigger and bigger and bigger.

01:28.300 --> 01:34.390
I have more and more switches and all of these switches are part of the same layer 2 domain are all

01:34.390 --> 01:41.240
connected to each other via layer 2 which means a couple of different things.

01:41.240 --> 01:51.210
Number one my switches contain a MAC Address table and the more ESX hosts and virtual machines that

01:51.210 --> 01:59.290
I have in my network the larger those MAC address tables are going to get and at a certain point there

01:59.290 --> 02:05.590
may be so many entries in those MAC address tables that they might fill up.

02:05.690 --> 02:10.150
So there's limited saleability from a MAC Address table perspective.

02:13.380 --> 02:19.020
Put probably the more glaring concern here is what about spanning tree.

02:19.120 --> 02:24.610
I've got so many switches and I'm going to have to interconnect the switches somehow.

02:24.850 --> 02:32.880
And the likelihood of creating a loop in my lair to network grows as I add more and more switches.

02:33.250 --> 02:39.240
So the letter to spanning tree domain is going to get larger and larger and larger.

02:39.410 --> 02:46.190
And as a result it's going to be harder and harder for the switches to figure out how to design a loop

02:46.190 --> 02:49.940
free typology.

02:50.000 --> 02:59.450
And so all of these factors can limit the scalability of our physical network if we're not using Vieques

02:59.510 --> 03:01.520
land and sex.

03:01.520 --> 03:05.480
Now how does this change when we deploy NSX.

03:05.480 --> 03:10.940
Well now we have the ability to insert a layer 3 device in the physical network.

03:12.740 --> 03:20.450
So now I've inserted a router in the physical network basically cutting my lair to domain and has half

03:20.450 --> 03:24.430
the switches are on one side of the router and the other half are on the other side.

03:24.740 --> 03:31.160
And the impact of this change is going to be that the MAC address table and every single one of those

03:31.160 --> 03:33.840
switches is going to be immediately cut in half.

03:35.340 --> 03:35.680
All right.

03:35.710 --> 03:40.960
The switches on the bottom don't need to know about the MAC addresses on top and the switches on the

03:40.960 --> 03:44.290
top don't need to know about the MAC address is on the bottom.

03:44.290 --> 03:49.030
So immediately I have the impact of cutting that MAC Address table in hand.

03:50.400 --> 03:53.490
And the other major impact is my spinning tree domain.

03:53.640 --> 03:56.570
It's also immediately cut in half by this round.

03:56.880 --> 04:00.840
And this is not possible with a Vee's for a distributed switch.

04:00.840 --> 04:01.050
Right.

04:01.050 --> 04:09.870
We need VX saline to give us that encapsulation process and to give us those VX LAN tunnels so that

04:09.870 --> 04:19.710
the traffic can flow through a router even if it's Leor to traffic and so my underlying network is now

04:19.740 --> 04:22.190
my Lehre three network.

04:22.260 --> 04:29.310
And remember that's what we refer to this this network on the of the physical switches and the physical

04:29.310 --> 04:30.180
router share.

04:30.300 --> 04:37.270
This is my underly physical network that interconnects all of the ESX hosts.

04:37.560 --> 04:45.290
But the fact that I have a layer 3 underlay does not at all impact the operation of my logical switches.

04:45.570 --> 04:49.700
I can still have the same logical switch on this ESX I host.

04:49.740 --> 04:58.300
And on this ESX I host and they can communicate via Lerer to cars as that traffic leaves those hosts.

04:58.350 --> 05:04.880
Its V xplain encapsulated and delivered to the top of the destination host.

05:06.200 --> 05:12.290
Soviet sun has a major impact on the scalability of our physical network because we now don't have to

05:12.290 --> 05:15.950
create these enormous layer to networks anymore.

05:15.950 --> 05:19.670
We can divide up those Lehre two domains using routers.
