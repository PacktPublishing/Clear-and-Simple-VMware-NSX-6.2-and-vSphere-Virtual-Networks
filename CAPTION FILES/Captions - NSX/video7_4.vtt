00:00.340 --> 00:08.700
In this video I'll describe the NSX implementation of Natt or network address translation.

00:08.880 --> 00:13.490
And this is going to be deployed using the NSX at.

00:13.500 --> 00:15.550
So first off what is that.

00:15.570 --> 00:18.900
Why do we need a network address translation.

00:18.900 --> 00:24.780
Well essentially we're going to use that to replace one address with another.

00:24.780 --> 00:32.640
So for example it allows inbound and outbound communication between external networks and privately

00:32.760 --> 00:34.840
addressed virtual machines.

00:35.160 --> 00:43.060
We may have created a private IP addressing scheme on the inside of our network but those virtual machines

00:43.150 --> 00:44.770
may need internet access.

00:44.800 --> 00:50.530
They may need to be accessible by machines out there in the physical network.

00:50.650 --> 00:57.100
So if we're using private networks on the inside we have to perform nat to translate those addresses

00:57.460 --> 01:01.440
to publicly roundtable IP addresses.

01:01.490 --> 01:05.900
And here we see the three predefined ranges of addresses.

01:06.290 --> 01:14.030
So if your network includes addresses like these Those are private IP addresses the 10 0.09 0 range

01:14.380 --> 01:26.360
the 172 about 16 0 0 slash 12 range of IP addresses and $192 168 0 0 are all predefined standardized

01:26.450 --> 01:32.200
IP address ranges that are strictly reserved for private addresses.

01:35.870 --> 01:41.790
And this is a feature that standard it's supported by many vendors and it definitely predates NSX and

01:41.800 --> 01:43.890
that has been around forever.

01:44.470 --> 01:52.250
The NSX supports the source and destination that translations and we'll be taking a closer look at each

01:52.250 --> 01:52.990
of those.

01:53.060 --> 02:01.940
But essentially a source that is used on outgoing traffic to change a private source IP to a publicly

02:01.940 --> 02:09.830
roundtable source IP whereas destination that is used on incoming packets to change the destination

02:09.830 --> 02:10.930
IP.

02:10.940 --> 02:16.880
So for example there might be traffic coming into our network destined for a privately address machine

02:18.990 --> 02:26.430
but the sending device has used a public IP as the destination destination Nat will remove that public

02:26.430 --> 02:36.330
IP address and replace it with our internal private IP and X also support support address translation

02:36.960 --> 02:44.070
which allows many internal IPs to be translated to a single external address and it will use different

02:44.070 --> 02:49.200
ports for each internal address.

02:49.200 --> 02:58.200
So let's take a look at an example of a source NAT translation with NSX in an our diagram here we see

02:58.200 --> 03:04.800
a few things on the left hand side we see a Virtual Machine label that V.M. want.

03:05.000 --> 03:12.580
And that virtual machine has been assigned a private IP address of 192 not 168 not 110.

03:13.130 --> 03:18.470
And the virtual machine is connected to a logical switch called Vienna 0 0 2 which is connected to a

03:18.470 --> 03:21.050
distributed logical router.

03:21.280 --> 03:28.660
And then we see our transit logical switch connecting the DLR to the NSX Hajj which gives us our north

03:28.780 --> 03:33.070
south routing or external access.

03:33.190 --> 03:40.990
And finally on the external network I have a server with a public IP address and my virtual machine

03:41.050 --> 03:43.380
wants to ping the server.

03:45.750 --> 03:51.160
But VM one has an internal IP address and that IP address is not publicly roundtable.

03:52.630 --> 04:00.820
So that packet leaves virtual machine one bound for its default gateway and it flows through the NSX

04:00.820 --> 04:02.220
network to the edge

04:07.300 --> 04:16.760
when the packet arrives at the edge the NSX will perform a source not translation it will remove that

04:16.760 --> 04:26.250
private source ip of $192 168 not 1.10 and replace it with a publicly readable IP address.

04:26.360 --> 04:30.000
And then for that traffic to the external network.

04:30.290 --> 04:38.270
And now that this packet has a publicly ratable source IP when that traffic arrives at that external

04:38.570 --> 04:48.670
network and hits that server the server can send the response to that public IP address.

04:48.670 --> 04:56.790
Now let's consider a different scenario where we're going to perform a destination that in this case

04:56.790 --> 05:03.420
the external server on the far right meets the paying virtual machine one maybe VM one is a web server

05:04.050 --> 05:11.870
or maybe is enough server or something that needs to be accessed by machines that are out on the internet.

05:13.330 --> 05:18.600
VM one has an IP address that is not publicly ridable.

05:18.680 --> 05:22.170
So how do we get this configured how do we set this up.

05:23.000 --> 05:28.990
Well we'll go to the NSX hatch and we'll actually add a second IP address.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.780
And by the way you need to do this with source Nat as well.

05:32.690 --> 05:39.390
So go to the NSX hatch and we'll go to this interface that's connected to the external router and we

05:39.410 --> 05:43.090
assign it a second IP address that's publicly roundball

05:46.270 --> 05:53.860
and what will happen at that point is the external server will generate a packet bound for whatever

05:54.070 --> 05:58.150
public IP address we've established on that NSX edge.

05:58.270 --> 06:06.070
So let's say for example on the edge we configured to not to that 2.10 That's the secondary IP that

06:06.070 --> 06:09.120
we created on the interface of the NSX such

06:12.250 --> 06:16.800
the server will send a packet destined for that IP.

06:17.040 --> 06:18.680
It'll route through the Internet.

06:18.790 --> 06:26.330
It will hit that NSX edge on that IP and we will create a NAT translation basically saying if anything

06:26.330 --> 06:35.990
arrives destined for $2.2 2.10 removed 2.2 out to about 10 and replace it with 192 168.

06:36.050 --> 06:37.520
Not one that 10.

06:37.650 --> 06:44.460
And now my destination has been performed.

06:44.490 --> 06:51.540
So now the ping will flow onto the transmit logical switch hit the distributed logical router get routed

06:52.230 --> 06:54.270
hit my virtual machine.

06:54.510 --> 06:57.560
And now the process is complete.

06:57.590 --> 07:01.350
So that's how the NSX does source and destination Nat.

07:01.940 --> 07:06.440
And again it's important to keep in mind for every IP address we need to translate we're going to have

07:06.440 --> 07:09.710
to build that translation into the NSX.

07:09.890 --> 07:15.250
Now if you decide to do port address translation that's a little bit different.

07:15.350 --> 07:23.780
Poor address translation is not a one to one mapping that maps many internal devices to a single external

07:23.780 --> 07:24.750
IP.

07:24.890 --> 07:31.050
And this means you only need one publicly readable IP address that the big benefit and what it will

07:31.050 --> 07:39.750
do is it will assign a unique source port to every internal IP the destination port is not modified

07:41.870 --> 07:48.860
and that's how it will track which IP addresses are being mapped to which port so that it can actually

07:49.610 --> 07:59.270
take multiple internal IPs and translate them to a single publicly ratable IP address.

07:59.270 --> 07:59.590
All right.

07:59.600 --> 08:08.620
So in review the NSX performs now which allows us to establish communications between external networks

08:08.740 --> 08:16.030
and are privately addressed virtual machines a source that is used to take the source IP address of

08:16.030 --> 08:24.010
an outgoing packet and translate it to some publicly groundball IP address whereas destination that

08:24.070 --> 08:32.470
is used on incoming packets and it's used to change a publically roud a bowl destination IP to the private

08:32.560 --> 08:36.170
IP that's valid on the inside of our network.
