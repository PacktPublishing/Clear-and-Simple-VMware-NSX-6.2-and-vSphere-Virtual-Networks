00:00.360 --> 00:09.120
In this video I'll provide you with an introduction to NSX V.M. where new network virtualization platform

00:09.840 --> 00:16.480
will be specifically focusing on features of NSX version 6 dot to.

00:16.650 --> 00:21.210
So why NSX would do we need NSX for.

00:21.210 --> 00:28.010
Well let's think about what we have right now with a traditional physical network a traditional physical

00:28.010 --> 00:35.030
network presents some challenges like getting new physical network hardware deployed or what if we want

00:35.030 --> 00:37.270
a new violin or a new subnet.

00:37.520 --> 00:44.480
Well think about how long that takes within your organization because it often requires the cooperation

00:44.480 --> 00:47.490
of multiple departments.

00:47.490 --> 00:54.030
Now what if we can have the same level of abstraction with the network that we have with compute and

00:54.030 --> 00:55.470
storage.

00:55.530 --> 01:04.970
What if we could simply roll out new routers new firewalls new villans new virtual switches without

01:05.120 --> 01:10.660
any change being required in the physical network.

01:10.690 --> 01:12.900
That's what we're trying to do with NSX.

01:12.910 --> 01:21.510
We're trying to shift to a software defined network very similar to the way we have our virtual machines

01:21.510 --> 01:25.700
in a virtual datacenter right with a software defined datacenter.

01:25.800 --> 01:30.450
We don't care what types of servers are storage or networks we have.

01:30.450 --> 01:34.920
We just need to give our virtual machines the compute horsepower they need.

01:34.920 --> 01:41.420
We need to give them the space that they need in storage and we need to give my IP connectivity.

01:41.650 --> 01:49.380
And if we can establish and satisfy those needs for a virtual machine we're ready to go.

01:49.470 --> 01:55.670
Right so just like our physical hosts are now simply C.P. and memory capacity.

01:55.970 --> 02:01.580
And it doesn't really matter what type of physical host my VAMC are running on we're going to do the

02:01.580 --> 02:02.940
same with networking.

02:03.260 --> 02:09.380
My physical network is going to become what we call an underlying network and it's going to be simple

02:09.530 --> 02:12.550
transport capacity and that's it.

02:15.150 --> 02:22.350
So what we're going to try to accomplish with NSX is to take a lot of key network functions and virtualize

02:22.350 --> 02:22.930
them.

02:23.340 --> 02:28.300
So for example we're going to have an object called a logical switch.

02:29.580 --> 02:35.100
And the purpose of a logical switch is very similar to the other types of virtual switches that we have

02:35.610 --> 02:39.590
like a these first Daynard switch or Vee's for distributed switch.

02:39.620 --> 02:48.440
This is a new type of virtual switch and it introduces some key new capabilities that are essential

02:48.770 --> 02:50.590
to what we're trying to do with NSX.

02:51.620 --> 03:00.090
Most significant of which is it's going to provide us the land capability.

03:00.120 --> 03:08.490
Now what I mean by that is it's going to allow us to establish layer to Ethan at networks that can actually

03:08.490 --> 03:16.650
traverse a layer 3 physical network I can create anything that segment that actually spans a physical

03:16.650 --> 03:17.180
router.

03:17.220 --> 03:24.420
When I'm using a logical switch and will spend a lot of time in this course examining exactly how that

03:24.420 --> 03:30.500
works and the role that VX land transport plays in that capability.

03:31.850 --> 03:36.650
With FSX We're also going to virtualize routing.

03:36.780 --> 03:42.630
We're going to use something called the distributed logical router that provides routing between IP

03:42.630 --> 03:51.190
networks and the routing is performed to write within the hypervisor right within the ESX eyeholes So

03:51.190 --> 03:57.220
now if two virtual machines are on different networks but they're on the same host their traffic never

03:57.220 --> 03:58.860
needs to leave that host.

03:59.080 --> 04:00.190
In order to get round it

04:03.410 --> 04:11.140
and we'll refer to our distributed logical router as our east west router this is responsible for routing

04:11.140 --> 04:14.360
traffic within the NSX domain.

04:17.520 --> 04:24.330
Now one of the key characteristics of the distributed logical router is the fact that it's a kernel

04:24.330 --> 04:25.090
module.

04:25.350 --> 04:27.000
It's not a virtual machine.

04:28.890 --> 04:36.030
So what I mean by that is the DLR or distributor the logical router is a little piece of software that

04:36.030 --> 04:38.880
gets installed on each and every ESX host.

04:38.880 --> 04:41.990
It's not a VM it's not a virtual appliance.

04:42.240 --> 04:50.500
It's a kernel module that's built right into the ESX host another kernel module that's installed at

04:50.510 --> 04:54.010
the ESX host level is the distributed firewall.

04:55.600 --> 05:01.960
And the distributed firewall gives us micro segmentation which is one of the features that a lot of

05:01.960 --> 05:03.790
people are.

05:04.330 --> 05:04.770
Rephrase

05:07.550 --> 05:14.450
the distributed firewall provides micro segmentation and this is one of the key features that's driving

05:14.450 --> 05:18.250
the adoption of NSX.

05:18.250 --> 05:27.010
So with the distributed firewall we can create firewall rules that are enforced at the virtual Nic level.

05:27.250 --> 05:33.370
If traffic is leaving a VM and is bound for some other virtual machine that's connected to the same

05:33.370 --> 05:37.700
logical switch we can enforce a firewall rule on that traffic.

05:38.050 --> 05:43.430
So it allows us to basically bolt a firewall onto every virtual neck of every virtual machine.

05:45.560 --> 05:50.370
We're also going to have a number of NSX edge services.

05:50.570 --> 05:55.840
The NSX had just kind of like our Swiss Army knife of the NSX.

05:55.850 --> 06:04.220
It gives us features like firewalling load bouncing IPs second layer to an SSL VPN services and many

06:04.220 --> 06:05.400
other services.

06:06.460 --> 06:12.910
All right so the services gateway is actually a virtual appliance that can do many many things.

06:15.130 --> 06:20.710
So we'll take a look at all of the specifics of the different services as we work our way through this

06:20.710 --> 06:21.380
course.

06:22.820 --> 06:31.040
And sex also provides integration with third party solutions and it provides an API that allows us to

06:31.070 --> 06:34.870
tie into a third party cloud management platform as well.

06:39.450 --> 06:43.260
The NSX includes multiple planes right.

06:43.290 --> 06:46.890
The first plane we're going to talk about is the data plane.

06:47.120 --> 06:52.970
And we've got some components that reside within the data plane including alogical switches the distributor

06:52.970 --> 06:59.630
the logical router the distributed firewall and the NSX edge and all of these components have something

06:59.630 --> 07:07.720
in common traffic flows through them right my virtual machine traffic is switch to biological switch

07:08.460 --> 07:11.700
around it using a distributed logical router.

07:11.830 --> 07:17.230
It flows through the distributed firewall and if it is bound for some external network is going to flow

07:17.230 --> 07:24.980
through the NSX edge so this means that if one of these components were to fail it's going to have an

07:24.980 --> 07:33.110
impact on service and those are our data plane components components that are actually responsible for

07:33.560 --> 07:35.200
passing traffic.

07:35.360 --> 07:38.120
And if they fail there is an impact on service

07:40.730 --> 07:43.250
control plane components are different.

07:44.750 --> 07:52.410
Our NSX control plane includes things like the distributed logical router control via And the NSX controller

07:53.920 --> 07:59.130
and these control plane components don't have a direct impact on traffic.

07:59.200 --> 08:08.760
If they fail now that being said if the distributed logical route control VM fails it may eventually

08:08.760 --> 08:15.140
have an impact on traffic because this is what does dynamic routing updates.

08:15.180 --> 08:23.050
If the NSX controller fails our traffic isn't going to stop but our traffic might become less efficient.

08:24.450 --> 08:31.140
So the control plane isn't directly in the data plane but it's also not completely separated from the

08:31.140 --> 08:32.190
data plane.

08:32.700 --> 08:39.360
The way that the management plane is right management plane is purely management.

08:39.580 --> 08:46.570
This is things like the center NSX manager and ASX manager will always have a one to one relationship

08:46.570 --> 08:48.240
with the center.

08:48.420 --> 08:50.160
And these are management tools right.

08:50.160 --> 08:54.920
This is how we get in through the web client and actually make changes.

08:54.990 --> 09:00.510
So if these components fail they have no impact on network traffic whatsoever.

09:00.510 --> 09:08.800
They just impact our ability to manage and assess.

09:08.950 --> 09:16.850
Now as you prepare your environment and roll allow NSX one of the tasks you'll have to accomplish is

09:16.850 --> 09:24.440
a task called Host preparation and it's going to push something called kernel modules down to your ESX

09:24.590 --> 09:26.370
hosts.

09:26.390 --> 09:35.910
Now these curly fries now these kernel modules are made up of groups of VM where infrastructure bundles

09:35.970 --> 09:43.680
or VIPs there are basically little pieces of software that were going to install on the ESX hosts and

09:43.680 --> 09:50.730
they run directly within the hypervisor I think of them as little add on software that runs right in

09:50.730 --> 09:54.130
the ESX host.

09:54.290 --> 10:01.830
They're going to do things like the X LAN distributed logical router distributed firewall.

10:02.160 --> 10:02.730
Right.

10:02.780 --> 10:11.140
And they're pushed down to the individual host by NSX manager so NSX manager is responsible for essentially

10:11.140 --> 10:15.940
preparing my ESX I hosts to run an OS X features.

10:16.270 --> 10:22.660
It's going to install all of these necessary kernel modules directly on the ESX I hosts so that I can

10:22.660 --> 10:30.280
now enable things like the distributed logical router or so that I can create the Exley and backed logical

10:30.280 --> 10:36.270
switches.

10:36.350 --> 10:41.930
So let's take a look at a diagram here and start to walk through some of the network services that are

10:41.940 --> 10:44.070
virtualise.

10:44.240 --> 10:51.590
And here I see two ESX host the host on the left has a VM called VM one the host on the right has a

10:51.590 --> 10:58.950
VM called VM to and those two virtual machines are on the same network now down near the bottom of my

10:58.950 --> 11:03.870
first ESX host I see another virtual machine that's on a completely different network.

11:05.230 --> 11:11.580
When the hosts are interconnected using a physical switch a router and another physical switch.

11:11.640 --> 11:17.750
So these two ESX my hosts are on different networks they're on different Larry.

11:17.780 --> 11:24.970
Three networks and I know that because they're separated by a router.

11:25.020 --> 11:29.920
So here we see one of the most critical capabilities of the logical switch.

11:30.070 --> 11:37.500
I've now created a lair to ether net segment that both VM want and VM to can connect to.

11:37.500 --> 11:44.430
It spans multiple ESX hosts and it even spans the physical router that we see below.

11:46.500 --> 11:49.300
And I could create multiple logical switches.

11:49.300 --> 11:56.100
And so my VM that's on the 172 610 network will connect to a different logical switch.

11:58.920 --> 12:03.260
Now I may need to route traffic between these Vians right.

12:03.300 --> 12:12.120
If VM one wants to communicate with my VM that's on the 172 not 16:10 network VM one is going to send

12:12.120 --> 12:15.170
that traffic towards its default gateway.

12:15.290 --> 12:15.730
Right.

12:15.780 --> 12:22.170
Anything that's connected to logical switch 5 0 0 0 0 1 is going to be in a different network than logical

12:22.170 --> 12:25.120
switch 5000 to.

12:25.160 --> 12:31.250
So if they want to communicate across those networks that traffic is going to be sent to the default

12:31.250 --> 12:32.830
gateway.

12:33.030 --> 12:37.860
And in this case the default gateway that we're going to use is going to be the distributed alogical

12:37.860 --> 12:49.230
router which will handle routing between those logical switches right within the ESX host.

12:49.420 --> 12:57.960
We'll also use the distributed firewall to enforce firewall policies at the virtual neck level so VM

12:57.960 --> 13:06.300
one basically is essentially plugged into a distributed firewall and all of its traffic is analyzed

13:06.330 --> 13:09.400
before it even hits the logical switch.

13:09.420 --> 13:18.550
This gives us these micro segmentation capabilities to control traffic with firewall rules anywhere.

13:18.640 --> 13:25.810
And then finally we have our NSX edge which may be as providing edge firewall services or is providing

13:25.810 --> 13:32.930
a load balancer or a VPN or one of the other many solutions that the NSX can provide.

13:38.470 --> 13:44.980
There's a few important documents that you might want to check out and if you go to the V.M. where NSX

13:44.980 --> 13:52.540
resources page you can find all of these documents like the NSX network virtualization design guide.

13:52.550 --> 13:59.680
There's also a couple documents that are specific to Cisco showing you how to deploy NSX with the Nexus

13:59.770 --> 14:05.850
or Cisco U.S.'s And there was also Brownfield design and deployment guide.

14:05.860 --> 14:11.170
If you already have an existing virtual infrastructure and you want to layer and sex on top of that

14:11.650 --> 14:21.160
the brownfield design and deployment guide is a great way to get started.

14:21.170 --> 14:28.820
So in review a few key concepts from the lesson NSX includes a management control and data point traffic

14:28.820 --> 14:32.760
does not flow through the management or control plane components.

14:32.780 --> 14:38.840
It only flows through the data plane and the data plane includes objects like our logical switches are

14:38.840 --> 14:47.410
distributed logical router and our distributed firewall as well as the NSX Hach and ascites manager

14:47.590 --> 14:49.860
integrates with the center.

14:49.870 --> 14:53.290
This is going to provide us with all of our management functions.

14:53.290 --> 14:59.740
Once we register as a sex manager with the center we'll be able to manage all aspects of NSX using the

14:59.740 --> 15:00.640
Vee's for web client

15:03.540 --> 15:11.380
address ex-manager is also responsible for pushing the kernel modules down to our ESX hosts and enabling

15:11.380 --> 15:18.180
features like VX Slan the distributed firewall and the distributed logical router.

15:18.400 --> 15:24.270
And you can take NSX and Lerat on top of existing hardware and utilize the switches that you have.

15:24.270 --> 15:26.530
Right now it's non-disruptive.
