00:05.200 --> 00:13.700
In this video I'll explain equal cost multi-pass thing using the NSX atch.

00:13.760 --> 00:19.840
So we'll talk about the equal costs multi-pass things Sopore and what capabilities the NSX can provide.

00:19.970 --> 00:26.810
Well we'll talk about what happens when a failure of the NSX occurs if we haven't SCMP configuration

00:27.140 --> 00:30.260
and will also talk about compatibility issues with this feature.

00:32.810 --> 00:42.230
So as of NSX 6.1 equal cost multipath thing is now supported and traffic can traverse multiple edge

00:42.230 --> 00:44.430
gateways in a balanced manner.

00:45.480 --> 00:53.010
This method offers higher bandwidth supporting up to 10 gigabits per second per edge and a maximum of

00:53.160 --> 01:01.050
eight and a 6 and gateways can be deployed in this model.

01:01.290 --> 01:08.940
In this type of deployment all of the NSX and instances will form a neighbor relationship with the logical

01:08.940 --> 01:10.880
routing control virtual machine.

01:11.310 --> 01:18.450
So here we see the DL our control VM and all the NSX edges are going to form a routing peer relationship

01:18.780 --> 01:26.950
with the DLR control via And each of the edges will also form a neighbor relationship with the physical

01:26.950 --> 01:29.070
router as well.

01:29.260 --> 01:36.570
These dynamic routing protocols will help us recover from failures.

01:36.610 --> 01:44.870
So let's talk about what happens when an NSX edge fails and we have equal costs multipath and enable.

01:44.880 --> 01:52.740
So in this scenario we have traffic that's being distributed across multiple unique NSX edges these

01:52.800 --> 01:55.830
edges don't have any relationship with each other.

01:55.890 --> 02:02.610
There are no synchronization or sharing of state information between the NSX outages when they're an

02:02.640 --> 02:05.220
equal cost multi-pack the amount.

02:05.500 --> 02:14.050
And that means that if that fails all of the traffic and all of the link information associated with

02:14.050 --> 02:18.280
that edge also fails.

02:18.440 --> 02:26.540
And let's assume that the DLR and the NSX edges and the physical router are all using OSPF

02:29.940 --> 02:36.260
Well what this means is that if an NSX edge fails an update to the routing tables going to occur and

02:36.260 --> 02:42.360
the faster we can get this routing update pushed out the sooner that traffic will start flowing again.

02:43.410 --> 02:50.250
So this is very different than NSX you state for high availability state stateful high ability gives

02:50.250 --> 02:58.230
you an active and a standby and there's almost immediate fail over with NSX edge and equal cost multipath

02:58.230 --> 02:59.010
thing.

02:59.010 --> 03:06.510
We want to set a very aggressive dead timer with our routing protocol so that if an edge does fail the

03:06.510 --> 03:13.190
routing protocol will detect that really quickly an alternate routes will be used for that traffic.

03:13.220 --> 03:22.900
Now OSPF and BGP both support dead at intervals as short as three seconds the NSX edge and equal cost

03:22.900 --> 03:29.040
multipath mode is incompatible with some stateful features such as the NSX edge firewall.

03:29.920 --> 03:31.840
So let's take a look at an example.

03:33.200 --> 03:38.540
Here in this diagram let's say that virtual machine one generates some traffic bound for an external

03:38.540 --> 03:44.660
network and maybe somebody goes in and opens a web browser and points to a Web site like trayner test

03:44.680 --> 03:45.200
dot.

03:46.760 --> 03:49.040
As that traffic flows out.

03:49.070 --> 03:56.390
It's going to hit the NSX atch and the NSX edge will analyze the firewall to determine if that traffic

03:56.420 --> 04:02.090
should be allowed out or up and if it matches a permit rule and the firewall then yeah that traffic

04:02.090 --> 04:04.940
is going to be allowed to flow out to the external network.

04:06.900 --> 04:15.150
Now some response traffic comes back but this time instead of handing the NSX edge instance that is

04:15.150 --> 04:23.490
aware of the current state of this connection because we're using SCMP the return traffic might actually

04:23.490 --> 04:32.660
flow back in through a different at each equal cost multipath thing supports routes through multiple

04:32.660 --> 04:35.930
edges to and from the same destination.

04:36.600 --> 04:42.810
So that return traffic might potentially come in through a different edge and that other edge may not

04:42.810 --> 04:47.050
be aware of the state of that connection and it might block that traffic.

04:48.390 --> 04:59.340
So that's just something to consider if you're possibly thinking about utilizing the NSX edgin ECMO.

04:59.530 --> 05:06.460
Now let's take a look at how this behaves within a high availability cluster with three or more hosts

05:07.920 --> 05:14.840
so notice that we have two virtual machines on two different hosts and there's two different shared

05:14.840 --> 05:21.560
storage systems also available down here at the bottom of the screen and all of our hosts have access

05:21.560 --> 05:23.160
to all of our data stores.

05:23.570 --> 05:28.210
And this is important and it's of course is recommended as well.

05:28.250 --> 05:36.170
So let's assume that the host that adds to runtime fails something happens that ESX I host and it's

05:36.170 --> 05:45.570
no longer functioning well the files of that NSX edge are still intact on the data store.

05:45.680 --> 05:51.120
We can see the files for that Vergine machine are still sitting there and data store too and are accessible

05:51.330 --> 05:53.810
to our other ESX hosts.

05:53.850 --> 06:00.790
So this means that vse very high availability can bring up that failed edge on another host.

06:00.830 --> 06:01.010
Right.

06:01.020 --> 06:03.510
That edge can come up just like any other virtual machine.

06:05.280 --> 06:09.420
The edge can now re-establish those neighbor relationships.

06:09.510 --> 06:18.170
And we can begin equal costs multi-pack think again.

06:18.230 --> 06:23.310
One final consideration to bear in mind here we see a couple of NSX agist.

06:23.450 --> 06:30.710
I'd label them active edge or stand by Edge but in reality they could both be independent Agis configured

06:30.710 --> 06:32.440
for equal cost multipath.

06:33.580 --> 06:40.000
Regardless I want to make sure that these edges stay on the appropriate hosts.

06:40.060 --> 06:45.420
There's not really a whole lot of point in doing equal costs multipath thing and having multiple edges

06:45.760 --> 06:50.280
if those edges get moved by address and end up on the same host.

06:50.290 --> 06:58.330
So we want to create anti affinity rules to govern that these virtual machines should not end up on

06:58.330 --> 07:01.380
the same ESX I host.

07:01.470 --> 07:07.050
So now we can see in this cluster maybe we have fully automated DRM enabled.

07:07.200 --> 07:12.660
And so what has happened here is both of these victims both of these NSA gadgets have gotten migrated

07:12.660 --> 07:14.230
to the same host.

07:14.550 --> 07:16.180
And if that host fails.

07:16.290 --> 07:19.840
Well now we're out of luck because we've lost both of our NSX outages.

07:19.920 --> 07:25.350
So of course we want to create some management controls that prevent this.

07:25.590 --> 07:33.450
And the way to accomplish that is to configure a as anti affinity role to force those edges to remain

07:33.450 --> 07:35.290
on different ESX I.

07:37.980 --> 07:44.970
So in review the NSX now supports equal cost multi-pack thing as of NSX 6.1.

07:45.120 --> 07:52.230
And this allows us to balance out the egressed traffic workload over multiple agist and multiple ESX

07:52.370 --> 07:53.760
host.

07:53.790 --> 07:57.060
There is no synchronization there's no stateful fail over.

07:57.060 --> 07:59.690
There's no active in standby.

07:59.730 --> 08:06.210
Each one of the edges is independent virtual machines and they don't synchronize with each other.

08:06.440 --> 08:12.000
And if one of them fails the network will heal itself using dynamic routing protocols.

08:12.040 --> 08:17.860
So we want to see very aggressive dead timers with equal costs multipath thing so that if a failure

08:17.860 --> 08:20.970
does occur the fail over happens very quickly.

08:22.770 --> 08:29.160
And again SCMP is incompatible with stateful features such as the NSX Hadj firewall and network address

08:29.160 --> 08:29.810
translation.
