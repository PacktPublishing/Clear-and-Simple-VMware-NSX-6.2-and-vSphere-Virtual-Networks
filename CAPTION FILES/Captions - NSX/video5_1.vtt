00:00.250 --> 00:06.810
In this video I'll explain the concepts behind the distributed logical router and how it can be used

00:07.500 --> 00:11.190
as an east west router and an NSX deployment.

00:13.270 --> 00:20.430
So here we see an example of east west routing performed with a physical router Let's follow this in

00:20.850 --> 00:26.940
as it moves from virtual machine one to virtual machine to and notice my VM here they're on different

00:26.940 --> 00:29.130
IP address ranges.

00:29.140 --> 00:36.440
VM one is on the 1 9 2 1 6 8 dot 1.10 IP address whereas VM is on a completely different network ten

00:36.440 --> 00:38.880
not one not one not 10.

00:38.930 --> 00:44.450
And if you want to pass traffic between two different networks that traffic has to flow through a router

00:47.520 --> 00:55.650
a VM one wants to send some ping or some other traffic to virtual machine to it's going to create an

00:55.650 --> 01:05.200
IP packet destined for its default gateway and the packet will flow out of VM one hit the default gateway

01:05.270 --> 01:11.800
that's been assigned within the guest operating system a VM one which in this case is a physical router

01:12.340 --> 01:14.830
and the router will do a routing table look up.

01:14.830 --> 01:19.380
It will determine the best way to get to the 10 1 one network.

01:19.820 --> 01:25.330
It'll routed out a different interface maybe different Vili's an interface and the packet will flow

01:25.330 --> 01:30.680
back through the physical switch and eventually to virtual machine to.

01:30.730 --> 01:38.370
And so even though these two VAMC are running in the exact same physical host as each other their traffic

01:38.460 --> 01:46.680
is flowing out of VM one right through a virtual switch out of a VM Nic a physical adapter through a

01:46.680 --> 01:49.090
physical switch getting a.

01:50.150 --> 01:56.570
Falling back into that same physical switch back through the same physical adapter and eventually arriving

01:56.660 --> 01:58.000
at the destination.

01:59.390 --> 02:05.930
Not really the most ideal path for that traffic to take.

02:06.000 --> 02:13.800
So let's say instead of using a physical router we use a virtual machine based router.

02:13.990 --> 02:19.360
Maybe the NSX edge for example is a virtual machine that can act as a router.

02:20.850 --> 02:25.050
Well just looking at this diagram you can probably guess where this is going.

02:25.050 --> 02:32.490
VM one and VM two are on the same ESX host as each other but they can't directly communicate any traffic

02:32.490 --> 02:37.970
between them has to flow through a router because they're on different IP networks.

02:38.020 --> 02:45.910
So here goes my packet through my virtual switch over the physical switch into another ESX host where

02:45.910 --> 02:53.620
my NSX exists and the NSX edge routes it pushes it back over the physical that work towards the receiving

02:53.620 --> 02:54.300
VM.

02:55.170 --> 02:59.730
And so now again my traffic has taken a really not ideal path.

02:59.730 --> 03:06.720
Right it's left VM one gone through a virtual switch over this physical adapter over this physical switch

03:07.470 --> 03:13.070
through the other physical adapter to the edge which routes it pushes it out.

03:13.110 --> 03:17.430
Maybe even that same VM neck over that same physical switch.

03:18.970 --> 03:25.490
And eventually the traffic reaches VM to for two beams that are sitting right next to each other.

03:25.530 --> 03:34.750
This is a really long way for that traffic to go so what if we can deploy a router right within the

03:34.750 --> 03:35.950
hypervisor.

03:36.070 --> 03:41.270
What if we could run a router right inside of that ESX host.

03:41.590 --> 03:45.820
And that's how we're going to route with the distributed logical router.

03:47.420 --> 03:53.750
And there's going to be a kernel module instance a router that runs on each and every one of these ESX

03:53.830 --> 03:54.870
hosts.

03:55.280 --> 04:00.170
It's called the distributed logical router because it's centrally configured.

04:00.740 --> 04:11.180
And then a copy of it is distributed to all of my ESX hosts the DLR or distributed logical router supports

04:11.210 --> 04:16.220
OSPF in BGP routing protocols and it supports IP version 6 as well.

04:19.890 --> 04:29.140
So let's talk about some of the aspects of the distributed logical router or DLR the DLR behaves like

04:29.140 --> 04:30.420
a normal router.

04:30.580 --> 04:32.780
It's going to have interfaces.

04:32.890 --> 04:39.070
So some of those interfaces are going to be called VX land lifts or logical interfaces.

04:39.130 --> 04:45.940
Any interface that connects to a logical switch is called the VX landline and the interface that connects

04:45.940 --> 04:50.160
to a distributed switch is called a landline.

04:50.470 --> 04:56.470
And if you've ever worked with the Cisco router These are similar to sub interfaces or via LAN interfaces

04:56.590 --> 05:00.520
on a physical router a very similar concept.

05:01.280 --> 05:06.220
Where each logical interface connects to a different VX LAN or different Villon.

05:06.530 --> 05:13.130
And now we can route traffic from one layer to segment to another.

05:13.130 --> 05:18.980
So for example let's say that all of these virtual machines are running on the same ESX I host.

05:18.980 --> 05:19.480
Right.

05:19.520 --> 05:26.910
If VM one wants to ping VM to Will those virtual machines are on different networks right.

05:26.940 --> 05:36.990
I can see V.M. one is $192 168 1.10 and it's connected to a logical switch but rather than that traffic

05:36.990 --> 05:44.540
flowing out to some physical network or virtual machine VM one will send that traffic to its default

05:44.570 --> 05:53.960
gateway which is a logical interface on the DLR and the DLR will then route that traffic towards the

05:53.960 --> 05:55.150
appropriate network.

05:56.770 --> 06:04.300
So now we can do all of these routing functions when I call first hop a routing right within the ESX

06:04.300 --> 06:07.540
I host.

06:07.570 --> 06:14.150
So let's take a closer look at how this EastWest routing is performed and how the distributed and logical

06:14.150 --> 06:15.500
route router works.

06:15.540 --> 06:21.190
Here we see two ESX hosts ESX Hiser one and ESX icier auto.

06:21.410 --> 06:27.440
And I've got two virtual machines in my diagram V.M. one which is connected to the red logical switch

06:27.440 --> 06:28.130
on the top.

06:28.130 --> 06:31.910
V.N. I 5 0 0 0 and 2 and then down towards the bottom right.

06:31.910 --> 06:37.600
I have a virtual machine called V.M. too and that's on logical switch V.N. I 5000 one.

06:37.820 --> 06:44.670
So these are two virtual machines on two different networks right and then I also see my Wii taps at

06:44.670 --> 06:53.840
the bottom of each ESX host and my physical underlay network that connects those ESX hosts.

06:53.860 --> 07:02.600
And now let's say that VM one generates a ping destined for virtual machine to well because virtual

07:02.600 --> 07:10.640
machine 2 is on some other network the guest operating system VM one let's say it's Windows.

07:10.640 --> 07:15.780
Windows is going to recognize this packets bound for some other network.

07:15.800 --> 07:18.280
It's not on the same network that I am.

07:18.360 --> 07:22.560
So a VM one will do is it'll send that packet to its default gateway

07:25.400 --> 07:31.790
which is a VX LAN logical interface on the distributed logical router.

07:32.000 --> 07:38.810
So the DLR then uses its routing table to determine which interface it should route that packet out

07:38.810 --> 07:45.420
of and is slug's the correct interface and routes that packet towards this logical switch.

07:45.570 --> 07:52.340
Vienna five thousand one which is on the same network as the destination IP.

07:52.500 --> 07:56.900
And at this point the job of the distributed logical router is actually done right.

07:57.060 --> 07:59.250
There's no more routing that needs to happen here.

08:00.200 --> 08:07.840
Now the packet came from VM one on one logical switch and the DLR received it and routed it to the appropriate

08:07.900 --> 08:09.780
logical switch.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.620
So the DLR is finished.

08:14.610 --> 08:20.560
All right at this point the frame has been dropped on to Vienna 5 0 0 0 0 and 1 and that's the logical

08:20.560 --> 08:20.900
switch.

08:20.920 --> 08:22.630
VM 2 is connected to.

08:22.990 --> 08:31.610
However we still need to move this frame from host ESX 0 1 to host ESX 0 2.

08:32.150 --> 08:37.710
And so what's going to happen now is the Mac table's going to be used to determine what the tap in that

08:37.730 --> 08:45.990
frame should be forwarded to and the type that it should go to is the type to an IP address 172 not

08:46.040 --> 08:48.330
16 not 10 not 11.

08:48.380 --> 08:54.410
So now at this point the source via tap will wrap that frame up in a new outer header.

08:54.700 --> 09:02.210
It'll assign those source and destination IPs in the I had her and all of those VX LAN had header information

09:02.210 --> 09:09.590
that we need and the frame will traverse the physical network arrive at the destination via tap where

09:09.620 --> 09:12.160
all of those headers will be stripped off.

09:13.150 --> 09:16.690
And the packet will be delivered to V.M. to.

09:16.760 --> 09:23.930
So in review we learned about the distributed logical router in this lesson we learned about how it

09:23.960 --> 09:29.630
eliminates hair pinning and hair pinning is when that traffic was flowing out to some physical router

09:30.020 --> 09:33.760
or some virtual machine router unnecessarily.

09:33.950 --> 09:41.090
It eliminates those unnecessary wire hops that our traffic was taking and it routes it right within

09:41.090 --> 09:45.640
the hypervisor as a kernel module.

09:45.680 --> 09:52.520
We learned that the DLR has interfaces called lefse or logical interfaces and that those interfaces

09:52.520 --> 09:56.450
act as the default gateway for our virtual machines.

09:56.450 --> 10:01.850
If our virtual machines are connected to a logical switch their default gateway will be a VX LAN Leffe

10:02.840 --> 10:07.460
if they're connected to a distributed port group those interfaces are called V landlubbers.
