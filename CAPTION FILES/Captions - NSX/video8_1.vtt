00:00.400 --> 00:06.070
In this video I'll explain the firewall services that are provided by NSX.

00:06.630 --> 00:13.790
Will take some time to look at the different security features that NSX provides.

00:13.810 --> 00:19.350
We'll look at the NSX edge firewall and compare it to the NSX distributed firewall.

00:19.660 --> 00:25.200
We'll look at different types of rules that we can create and the actions that those rules can take.

00:26.460 --> 00:33.000
And we'll also look at that apology of an NSX network and go through some packet walks and show you

00:33.000 --> 00:42.070
how these packets are processed by these firewall tools as they work their way through our network.

00:42.100 --> 00:48.980
And let's start out by first off explaining a few key concepts that you need to know.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.450
Now number one the NSX edge is a stateful firewall.

00:53.560 --> 00:54.730
So what does that mean.

00:54.730 --> 00:56.560
What is a stateful firewall.

00:58.280 --> 01:00.190
Well let's take a look in an example.

01:00.350 --> 01:02.170
So here we see three virtual machines.

01:02.180 --> 01:04.480
VM one two in three.

01:04.730 --> 01:12.490
And let's say that VM one generates some traffic that is flowing out to the external network and that

01:12.490 --> 01:22.940
traffic matches a permit rule in the ANOSIKE such.

01:22.990 --> 01:30.280
So the NSX edge is going to allow that traffic through because it matches this permit We're all and

01:30.280 --> 01:37.960
the other thing that the NSX will do is it'll update the connections state in the NSX edge to reflect

01:37.990 --> 01:40.360
that that connection has been opened.

01:40.360 --> 01:43.690
And now the traffic passes through and hits the destination.

01:44.080 --> 01:52.800
So the NSX edge is tracking the fact that VM one has opened some connection with some external device.

01:52.870 --> 02:03.100
And if response traffic comes back from that external device the NSX edge will allow that response traffic

02:03.100 --> 02:03.920
through.

02:04.000 --> 02:13.700
Based on that connection state so the edge doesn't require an explicit entry saying this return traffic

02:13.700 --> 02:14.480
is allowed.

02:14.840 --> 02:21.340
It dynamically allows that traffic back in because it's a stateful firewall based on the connections

02:21.340 --> 02:21.910
state.

02:21.970 --> 02:32.190
It will allow return traffic through the distributed firewall is a firewall that is sent out to the

02:32.190 --> 02:40.290
kernel modules of all of our ESX I hosts It's a host based firewall and it's what gives us the ability

02:40.290 --> 02:43.900
to have micro segmentation.

02:43.910 --> 02:49.640
So for example in this diagram we have two virtual machines V.M. one and VM two.

02:49.850 --> 02:55.390
And let's say that VM one wants to establish a connection to virtual machine to write.

02:55.400 --> 02:59.550
Maybe it wants to ping it maybe it wants to open a web page on it whatever.

03:00.290 --> 03:04.550
So VM one generates a packet and that's bound for VM too.

03:05.020 --> 03:12.560
And if we're using a physical firewall that packet needs to flow over a physical adapter a VM neck hit

03:12.560 --> 03:18.980
a physical switch hit the physical firewall get processed by the firewall ruleset come back hit the

03:18.980 --> 03:24.680
physical switch flow through the VM neck yet again and arrive at virtual machine too.

03:24.710 --> 03:29.490
These are two vim's that might be on the same exact ESX host as each other.

03:30.620 --> 03:38.180
And our packet has gone through multiple physical devices in order to hit that firewall policy.

03:38.220 --> 03:45.600
This is referred to as Herr penning sending traffic over the physical network unnecessarily and then

03:45.600 --> 03:51.320
its coming right back in to hit that destination via.

03:51.320 --> 03:59.110
So this is not really the most efficient possible way to deal with enforcement firewalls.

04:01.850 --> 04:09.160
Now let's look at an example of east west firewalling using the NSX hatch.

04:09.560 --> 04:17.030
And this is not what the NSX had just built for the NSX edge for a north south traffic.

04:17.170 --> 04:24.480
That means traffic that's coming into or leaving my NSX domain.

04:24.620 --> 04:28.790
But I can use that as a firewall between virtual machines if I want.

04:30.380 --> 04:39.030
So again here we see a packet coming from VM one it's bound for VM to and my NSX edge firewall is running

04:39.030 --> 04:41.480
on some other ESX I host.

04:41.760 --> 04:47.580
While that packet needs to flow through a physical adapter over a physical switch back in through another

04:47.580 --> 04:55.740
physical adapter to hit that NSX Aggi virtual appliance and then the firewall rules set will be enforced

04:55.740 --> 05:01.390
on that packet and the pagen now has to travel to the actual destination.

05:01.390 --> 05:08.460
So here goes over a physical VM neck over a physical switch back into the original host over a VM neck.

05:08.620 --> 05:10.920
And now it hits its destination.

05:11.160 --> 05:19.540
And this is why the NSX edge is not ideal for EastWest firewalling because we still have the same hair

05:19.540 --> 05:27.080
pinnings situation that we had with a physical firewall appliance.

05:27.090 --> 05:34.900
Now how is the distributed firewall different well with a distributed firewall.

05:35.160 --> 05:39.180
That traffic doesn't have to leave the host at all.

05:39.180 --> 05:45.070
The distributed firewall runs as a kernel module in our ESX host.

05:45.540 --> 05:54.440
It's deployed by NSX manager during the host preparation process and runs as a demon called V S F W

05:54.450 --> 05:57.890
D on each ESX host.

05:57.960 --> 06:07.080
So because the firewall runs as a kernel module right within the ESX host we can enforce firewall rules

06:07.110 --> 06:12.060
at the virtual Nic level of our virtual machine.

06:12.090 --> 06:14.430
That's how the distributed firewall works.

06:14.430 --> 06:21.290
It actually analyzes those packets as they leave the VM before they even had a logical switch.

06:21.300 --> 06:25.050
So now I can create my firewall rules anywhere I want.

06:25.200 --> 06:32.810
I can enforce rules between virtual machines that are even on the same logical switches each other and

06:32.810 --> 06:40.230
that's what gives me that feature of micro segmentation that's so desirable with NSX.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.870
I can create a firewall rule anywhere I want.

06:44.240 --> 06:51.560
It's really as if a firewall has been bolted to the virtual neck of every VM and every VM plugs directly

06:51.560 --> 06:52.650
into a firewall.

06:53.580 --> 06:58.450
And from there they plug in the switches so it's extremely powerful.

07:00.360 --> 07:07.410
Now it's also important to know that these firewall rules are pushed out to the hosts by an ex manager

07:07.410 --> 07:08.740
directly.

07:08.850 --> 07:19.200
My NSX controller cluster and user world agent are not involved with the firewall at all.

07:19.370 --> 07:24.080
So let's walk through an example of how the distributed firewall works.

07:24.170 --> 07:31.300
Now here in our diagram we see two ESX hosts on the left we've got ESX eyes or one on the right ESX

07:31.380 --> 07:35.650
0 2 and running on host ESX 0 1.

07:35.660 --> 07:39.700
I have a VM called VM one running on ESX Isar or two.

07:39.710 --> 07:45.950
I've got a VM called VM too and these two virtual machines are plugged in to different logical switches

07:48.000 --> 07:56.990
and so let's say that VM one wants to establish a connection with VM too maybe it generates a ping that's

07:56.990 --> 08:03.610
bound for VM to and VM 2 is on a different network then V.M. one.

08:04.070 --> 08:10.970
So my virtual machine is going to send that packet to its default gateway which is the distributed logical

08:10.970 --> 08:11.620
router.

08:11.780 --> 08:19.670
But prior to ever hitting the logical switch or the distributed logical router the distributed firewall

08:19.700 --> 08:22.780
will analyze that packet immediately.

08:24.430 --> 08:32.200
As soon as that packet is transmitted by V.M. one it's immediately inspected by the distributed firewall.

08:32.430 --> 08:40.380
And if it matches the firewall rules and is permitted it'll hit the logical switch and flow to the distributed

08:40.380 --> 08:45.120
logical router which is the default gateway for that virtual machine.

08:46.590 --> 08:55.630
And all of this is done prior to any sort of VX land cancellation.

08:55.630 --> 08:59.690
So at this point the distributor a logical router will route it towards the end.

08:59.730 --> 09:01.450
Five thousand two.

09:01.660 --> 09:05.810
That's where the destination virtual machine resides.

09:05.830 --> 09:13.920
So the packet gets routed it gets the xplain encapsulated and it flows over my physical underly network

09:17.390 --> 09:25.030
and when it reaches host ESX high 0 2 it's dropped on to the appropriate logical switch which is VNA

09:25.070 --> 09:33.070
5000 to and at that point the Wii tap the capsule eight's it rips away all of those VX land hatters

09:36.010 --> 09:43.940
and now my packet is on the logical switch and is destined for V.M. to before it can go into VM to though

09:44.240 --> 09:50.420
before it can be received by V.M. to it is again analyzed by the distributed firewall.

09:50.420 --> 09:57.340
Looking at the set of rules that are specifically applied to VM to and again this is happening at the

09:57.340 --> 10:00.590
virtual neck level of VM to.

10:00.760 --> 10:08.800
And if that traffic is allowed and it reaches my virtual machine so that's the role of the distributed

10:08.800 --> 10:15.980
firewall and how it works at the virtual next level.

10:16.000 --> 10:22.040
And that's a very important aspect to keep in mind here because that's really what opens up all these

10:22.040 --> 10:23.420
possibilities to us.

10:23.420 --> 10:29.330
You know I could have 10 different venoms unlogical switch Vienne five thousand one all on the same

10:29.330 --> 10:35.360
host and I can have different specific firewall policies for each of those victims.

10:35.450 --> 10:40.940
I can enforce policies between those victims even though they're connected to the same switch.

10:40.950 --> 10:48.590
Right this is the really groundbreaking part of the security aspects of sex called micro segmentation.
