In this video I'll explain NSX service composer and we'll talk about how it can be used to provide automation

00:08.580 --> 00:12.450
and third party integration for the NSX firewall.

00:15.260 --> 00:22.520
So Service composer is going to allow a pretty high level of automation in our NSX firewall using something

00:22.520 --> 00:25.090
called Dynamic tagging.

00:25.120 --> 00:32.680
It can also allow us to integrate with third party services like anti-virus or intrusion prevention

00:32.680 --> 00:37.300
systems and it does so using two types of objects.

00:37.300 --> 00:43.870
Security Groups and security policies it can provide guest introspection services.

00:43.970 --> 00:50.770
And this is really useful for data loss prevention tools or anti-virus tools.

00:50.790 --> 00:58.990
It can also provide network introspection which is useful for deploying some sort of third party intrusion

00:59.020 --> 01:01.110
prevention system.

01:01.330 --> 01:08.560
And it also has dynamic and static inclusion rules to govern what actually gets dropped into our security

01:08.560 --> 01:09.200
groups.

01:10.140 --> 01:18.150
Service composer provides a high level of automation and we are going to create something called security

01:18.150 --> 01:25.860
groups that basically associate objects that we want to protect such as virtual machines.

01:25.930 --> 01:29.470
The app's resource pools host clusters.

01:29.470 --> 01:36.310
They can even be made up of simply IP sets and an active directory security groups as well.

01:37.190 --> 01:43.670
We can even create security groups based on virtual machine information like the operating system type

01:43.970 --> 01:45.670
or the virtual machine name.

01:45.800 --> 01:55.300
And there's many other security group dynamic membership configurations that we can create.

01:55.300 --> 02:01.960
So essentially what we're trying to do here is create a group of objects that we want to apply some

02:01.960 --> 02:05.680
rules to and that's what our security policies are.

02:05.920 --> 02:12.640
Our security policies are going to be the rules and services that we want to apply to these objects.

02:14.150 --> 02:16.960
They could even be simple firewall rules.

02:17.060 --> 02:19.550
A security policy can be as simple as that.

02:19.730 --> 02:26.990
Or maybe I want to forward traffic to an intrusion prevention system or maybe I want to have an anti-virus

02:26.990 --> 02:31.540
solution that scans those virtual machines using d'Este introspection

02:35.430 --> 02:38.550
so step one is going to be creating our security groups.

02:40.680 --> 02:44.250
And we have a couple different ways that we can do this.

02:44.370 --> 02:53.010
We can use dynamic inclusion and dynamic inclusion will automatically add objects to a security group

02:53.100 --> 03:00.360
based on a wide variety of criteria like the operating system and the computer name the virtual machine

03:00.360 --> 03:07.480
name security tags that have been applied by an anti-virus solution for example.

03:07.520 --> 03:13.550
We can also define static inclusion and a static exclusion criteria.

03:13.790 --> 03:21.380
So if there are certain objects that I want to make sure are not included in some security group I can

03:21.380 --> 03:29.730
statically either include or exclude those objects and I can do it on any of these object types that

03:29.730 --> 03:31.340
you see listed here.

03:31.470 --> 03:39.240
I can say certain virtual machines should be included in the security group certain hosts or clusters

03:39.510 --> 03:46.800
should be included in the security group or I can even identify individual virtual next or IP addresses

03:46.890 --> 03:49.180
or Active Directory security groups.

03:49.180 --> 03:51.400
We've got a lot of flexibility here.

03:52.680 --> 03:58.140
And I can statically exclude objects based on all that same criteria

04:01.680 --> 04:02.070
Okay.

04:02.150 --> 04:08.900
So before we move any deeper here let's quickly just review the security groups.

04:08.960 --> 04:15.830
These are what we want to protect and we can create a security group that includes a bunch of virtual

04:15.830 --> 04:22.670
machines and then I can apply some security policy to that security group.

04:22.700 --> 04:29.570
So for example I might create a security group for all of my database virtual machines and I might have

04:29.570 --> 04:36.330
a specific set of firewall rules geared towards my database via UPS in a security policy.

04:37.130 --> 04:45.460
Now I only need to create one rule to enforce that policy to that group of virtual machines.

04:45.550 --> 04:49.520
And that's what these security groups and policies are all about.

04:50.790 --> 04:53.550
And they're also all about automation.

04:53.550 --> 05:01.140
Now notice here all of this dynamic inclusion criteria let's focus on the virtual machine name for a

05:01.140 --> 05:11.200
moment if I simply name all of my database VMS something that includes the letters D-B I can then create

05:11.500 --> 05:21.750
a security group that will detect any VM with the letters D.B in the name and what it will then do is

05:21.750 --> 05:26.420
I can assign a security policy to that security group.

05:26.430 --> 05:34.990
So the moment I create any virtual machine named D-B anything the appropriate firewall rules will be

05:35.080 --> 05:40.710
immediately applied based on its dynamic inclusion in a security group.

05:42.620 --> 05:48.620
You can set up a dynamic and static membership in the same security group if you want static.

05:48.650 --> 05:51.440
Exclusion takes precedence over anything.

05:51.740 --> 05:58.220
So if I create a rule to statically exclude certain objects that takes precedence over any of these

05:58.220 --> 06:00.330
other criteria that I might identify

06:04.690 --> 06:09.450
So how does all this help me as an administrator.

06:09.670 --> 06:18.250
Well let's compare a traditional firewall rule to those created with service composer.

06:18.270 --> 06:20.400
So here I see a few firewall rules.

06:20.400 --> 06:27.690
I have one rule that says app one an apt to are blocked from communicating with destinations the DB

06:27.690 --> 06:29.370
one and DB2.

06:29.910 --> 06:36.450
And then I've got another rule that says anything on V.N. 5000 to is allowed to communicate with anything

06:36.600 --> 06:39.260
on VNA five thousand one.

06:39.270 --> 06:46.740
So essentially I've created a firewall policy that is preventing Apple on an app to from talking to

06:46.740 --> 06:55.070
D-B one and D-B to but then after that I've got a rule that's allowing anything on that Vienne 5000

06:55.230 --> 06:59.150
to talk to V and five thousand one.

06:59.240 --> 07:06.040
So remember when we're looking at our firewall rules the first to match is ex-student So app one an

07:06.040 --> 07:13.210
app to cannot talk to divi one and DB2 even though the very next rule says Vee and five 5000 two can

07:13.210 --> 07:18.570
talk to Vienna five thousand one.

07:18.770 --> 07:25.500
However what about D-B 3 well app on an app to can talk to that.

07:25.540 --> 07:26.490
No problem.

07:28.660 --> 07:30.590
Because they don't match the first rule.

07:30.710 --> 07:33.470
But the second rule is a match.

07:33.540 --> 07:40.440
And now what if I add yet another app virtual machine called app 3 Well let's assume that DB You want

07:40.450 --> 07:43.400
NDB to our really sensitive data.

07:43.920 --> 07:53.070
I've just created a new VM and that new VM doesn't have any rules specifically applied to it so therefore

07:53.550 --> 08:00.710
it's on V.N. 5000 to the destination is in Vienna five thousand one app three is going to be able to

08:00.710 --> 08:03.390
communicate with D-B wan and D-B to

08:09.390 --> 08:16.490
what if instead of doing it that way where I might accidentally open up some holes in my security.

08:16.740 --> 08:25.380
I just created a security group called app group and any CMS with the letters APCP in their name are

08:25.380 --> 08:33.810
going to be dynamically included in the app group security group and any via SMS with the letters D.B

08:33.810 --> 08:39.380
and the name will be dynamically included in my DD group.

08:39.560 --> 08:45.470
And now I have one firewall rule at the beginning of my firewall rule ruleset that says app group can't

08:45.470 --> 08:47.560
talk to DB group.

08:47.580 --> 08:55.470
Now the moment I create any new db server it's going to be automatically protected.

08:55.520 --> 09:00.180
Not only that but my firewall rule set is extremely short.

09:00.230 --> 09:04.670
I don't have to have one rule for each DB virtual machine.

09:04.770 --> 09:07.930
They're all contained in this db group security group.

09:08.130 --> 09:13.730
So it has the added bonus of keeping my firewall rules set very short.

09:14.100 --> 09:22.350
Now one other side note I want to mention if there is a conflict between security policies the policy

09:22.380 --> 09:25.980
with the highest the weight takes priority.

09:26.460 --> 09:31.950
So by default when you create a new security policy it's automatically given the highest weight you

09:31.950 --> 09:38.580
can manually change those values but by default if there is a conflict between two security policies

09:38.910 --> 09:45.630
the newest security policy will win that conflict unless you go in there and manually configure the

09:45.640 --> 09:45.850
way.
