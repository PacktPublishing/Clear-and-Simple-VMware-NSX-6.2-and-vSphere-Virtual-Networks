00:00.300 --> 00:08.770
In this video I'll explain NSX edge high availability and sex edge is a virtual appliance that exists

00:08.770 --> 00:10.680
in the data point.

00:10.820 --> 00:16.910
And so it's very important that we maintain a high level of up time for the NSX edge virtual appliance

00:18.280 --> 00:23.050
what we're going to talk about in this video is specific to NSX Hatch.

00:23.260 --> 00:29.380
We're not going to be talking about VSE for high availability specifically but we will talk about how

00:29.380 --> 00:34.850
vse for high availability works with NSX edge ha.

00:35.060 --> 00:41.270
We'll take a look at how to protect the NSX edge with high availability will understand stateful high

00:41.270 --> 00:48.760
availability and we'll also take a look at what happens when an NSX edge fails.

00:48.840 --> 00:54.240
So the first thing to make sure that we understand is the NSX edge is in the data plane.

00:54.660 --> 01:01.750
So for example here on the left hand side of our diagram we see a virtual machine called V.M. 1 right.

01:01.780 --> 01:06.910
That's the virtual machine that's going to be sending some sort of traffic to an external network.

01:09.260 --> 01:16.040
So as VM one sends traffic to an external network that traffic is going to flow through a distributed

01:16.040 --> 01:17.160
logical router.

01:17.360 --> 01:25.690
That's the default gateway for virtual machine one and the DLR will wow that traffic to some interface

01:26.770 --> 01:33.250
a logical switch in this example that's a logical switch 5 0 0 0 0 2 and that logical switches connected

01:33.250 --> 01:35.550
to the other ESX I host.

01:35.560 --> 01:40.400
And it also has an interface that's connected to the NSX edge.

01:40.450 --> 01:46.960
So that's how VM once traffic actually makes it out into the physical external network.

01:50.340 --> 01:55.770
So we've got other components shown here like the NSX control or closter and it's not pictured but we've

01:55.770 --> 01:57.930
also got NSX manager.

01:58.110 --> 02:02.390
Those objects are not part of the data plan.

02:02.460 --> 02:09.390
The NSX edge is the traffic from VM one is going to actively flow through the edge in order to get to

02:09.390 --> 02:10.280
the Internet.

02:10.620 --> 02:15.960
So of course it's critically important that we protect this virtual machine because it's our only way

02:15.960 --> 02:16.350
out.

02:18.700 --> 02:26.680
So we can protect the NSX and using vse for high availability we can protect it using NSX edge services

02:26.710 --> 02:34.360
Gateway High availability and we can use a combination of those two solutions to kind of provide the

02:34.360 --> 02:36.350
maximum level of protection.

02:39.740 --> 02:44.340
So let's start by just explaining some of the fundamentals of high availability.

02:44.510 --> 02:50.480
And if you're familiar with these for H.A. this might be pretty familiar to you but just in case you're

02:50.480 --> 02:51.010
not.

02:51.290 --> 02:56.340
Let's take a moment to quickly review how these very high availability works.

02:57.460 --> 03:04.700
So here we see for ESX high hosts that are part of a high availability cluster and running out a host

03:04.820 --> 03:09.490
ESX size 0 1 is a VM called VM 1.

03:09.500 --> 03:18.950
Now if that first ESX host fails VM one is going to fail along with it or the virtual machine can't

03:18.950 --> 03:20.970
run without its host.

03:21.180 --> 03:26.340
But if you look down towards the bottom of the screen you notice here is V.M. once files those files

03:26.340 --> 03:27.670
are still intact.

03:27.800 --> 03:34.250
They're on some shared storage solution that's accessible to all of the ESX host in my closter

03:37.040 --> 03:40.590
So when that host fails the virtual machine fails along with it.

03:40.670 --> 03:42.300
But the files are left intact.

03:44.300 --> 03:52.100
So because those files still exist and they're still available to our other ESX I cohosts we are able

03:52.100 --> 03:55.490
to boot this virtual machine up on some other host.

03:55.730 --> 03:57.680
That's what high availability does.

03:57.800 --> 04:02.820
It doesn't give us zero downtime protection it doesn't give us 100 percent uptime.

04:02.840 --> 04:09.800
What it does is if a host fails and the VMS on that host will also fail but they will be subsequently

04:09.800 --> 04:16.560
booted up on other ESX host.

04:16.570 --> 04:20.010
Now how does this apply to the ANOSIKE sketch.

04:20.290 --> 04:23.270
Well the NSX edge is a virtual machine.

04:23.390 --> 04:25.870
It's a virtual appliance.

04:25.930 --> 04:27.620
So let's think about what happens here.

04:27.640 --> 04:36.630
Here we see the NSX adj running on ESX eyes 0 4 it's running on any ESX I host and that ESX host fails

04:37.780 --> 04:40.960
while now our egress point is gone.

04:41.030 --> 04:47.140
We don't have the NSX anymore and there is no way for my traffic to get to the external network.

04:48.590 --> 04:55.190
Now eventually that virtual machine will reboot on some other host because its files are still intact

04:55.250 --> 04:57.730
right there down here on shared storage.

04:59.020 --> 05:06.340
So it's just a matter of time before that virtual machine boots up on some other ESX host and is functional

05:06.340 --> 05:07.300
again.

05:07.300 --> 05:10.600
And now we're back in business.

05:10.750 --> 05:17.530
Now this takes some time or a reboot are required here and the level of downtime that we're going to

05:17.530 --> 05:25.150
experience with VSE for ha in most cases it's not really acceptable and we can't have five to 10 minutes

05:25.150 --> 05:28.060
of downtime if a host fails.

05:28.060 --> 05:31.340
We need to get that edge back up as quickly as possible.

05:32.470 --> 05:41.720
So if you can't tolerate that level of downtime you can consider using NSX edge high availability and

05:41.720 --> 05:44.000
with this configuration.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.690
There's actually two edge gateways that are created.

05:46.730 --> 05:53.180
One is an active mode and one is in standby mode and noticed they were on different data stores.

05:53.210 --> 06:00.860
Right they don't have that risk of a single storage failure taking down both NSX edges.

06:01.670 --> 06:06.380
These very high availability does not protect us from a storage failure.

06:06.700 --> 06:13.600
NSX edge ha does protect the edge virtual appliance from a storage failure.

06:13.790 --> 06:19.520
And this is the recommended configuration to place these two Reems on different data stores.

06:20.200 --> 06:25.630
And it's also important that those data stores are shared storage right that they're accessible to all

06:25.630 --> 06:28.000
of our ESX host.

06:28.030 --> 06:29.210
So how does this work.

06:29.220 --> 06:36.190
Well we have the active edge and the standby inch and they are going to regularly exchange heartbeats

06:38.140 --> 06:44.610
and if five heartbeats are missed this triggers what is called The Dead timer.

06:45.630 --> 06:50.050
So the dead timer expires once five heartbeats are missed.

06:50.070 --> 06:53.470
And by default heartbeats are sent every three seconds.

06:53.520 --> 06:58.870
So if the active edge fails the standby edge will stop getting heartbeats from it.

06:59.740 --> 07:08.210
And within 15 seconds it'll consider that active dead and it'll take over now 15 seconds.

07:08.330 --> 07:10.980
Even that might not be fast enough for you.

07:10.980 --> 07:11.300
Right.

07:11.480 --> 07:16.820
So you can actually adjust that dead timer down to as low as six seconds.

07:17.000 --> 07:23.360
But the V.M. were recommended best practice is to not go lower than nine seconds.

07:23.360 --> 07:29.360
Nine seconds is kind of the recommended minimum dead timer for NSX.

07:29.390 --> 07:36.830
Adj high availability so this is going to give us a much much faster fail over than vse fair.

07:36.840 --> 07:45.170
High Availability gave us and the good thing about NSX edge high availability is it supports all of

07:45.170 --> 07:48.270
our state full services.

07:48.320 --> 07:55.220
So if the standby edge has to take over there is going to be some impact there and the standby edge

07:55.610 --> 07:59.440
actually needs to bring some services online.

08:00.430 --> 08:02.140
When a fail over occurs.

08:02.490 --> 08:06.820
So the active edge is going to keep that standby edge synchronized.

08:06.870 --> 08:11.240
It's going to synchronize the important information like the forwarding table.

08:11.320 --> 08:19.020
It will synchronize firewall connection States load balancer States NAND translations important information

08:19.020 --> 08:27.250
like that all of those logical surfaces are synchronized between the active edge and they stand by inch.

08:27.260 --> 08:35.750
Now that being said it's not a 100 percent stateful fail over what's really going on here is the configuration

08:35.750 --> 08:39.680
of the active and standby edge are kept synchronized.

08:39.680 --> 08:46.460
But things like VPN connections for example that are active at the time of that failure.

08:46.460 --> 08:48.750
Those will need to be reestablished.

08:50.240 --> 08:58.880
Now one other configuration that we might want to consider if we're going to deploy NSX high availability

08:59.090 --> 09:02.610
is we may want to create an anti-fan of the role.

09:02.750 --> 09:09.560
So for example in this scenario we've got an active NSX said you're running on a host ESX eyes or three

09:10.150 --> 09:14.870
and we've got to stand by NSX Hadj running on host ESX 04.

09:15.260 --> 09:17.150
And this is fine right.

09:17.150 --> 09:19.250
This configuration looks good.

09:19.250 --> 09:29.200
However if D.R. wrasse is configured on this cluster This may create some issues for us so would dress

09:29.200 --> 09:36.190
or distributed resource scheduler does is it automatically moves virtual machines from host to host

09:36.720 --> 09:40.180
it does this in order to keep the hosts load balanced.

09:41.420 --> 09:48.200
In this scenario this could create a problem because we could potentially end up with the active and

09:48.200 --> 09:52.250
standby edge running on the same ESX host.

09:52.370 --> 09:58.960
And if that host were to now fail we would lose the active edge and the standby Ouch.

09:59.270 --> 10:04.070
So we need to make sure that these two virtual machines are kept separated.

10:04.070 --> 10:06.890
That's what an anti affinity role will do for us.

10:06.890 --> 10:14.270
It will guarantee that the active edge and the standby edge always remain on different hosts and that

10:14.300 --> 10:26.000
dress will never migrate those two virtual machines to the same host.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.330
Now let's talk a little bit about how routing works.

10:29.360 --> 10:37.610
Once we've enabled NSX had high availability because now we're going to have to NSX and gateways only

10:37.610 --> 10:41.490
the active edge actually Peares with routers.

10:41.580 --> 10:41.870
Right.

10:41.870 --> 10:50.050
So for example let's assume that the active edge fails are active edge has now failed.

10:50.060 --> 10:55.190
It's no longer available to pass traffic.

10:55.360 --> 11:04.390
If the active edge fails the standby now needs to take over and it needs to maintain those adjacencies

11:05.320 --> 11:07.260
that were stablished by the Active-X.

11:07.360 --> 11:13.480
So these standby edge needs to maintain an adjacency with the distributed logical router control VM

11:14.510 --> 11:15.980
and with the physical router

11:19.450 --> 11:26.640
to allow this to happen we want to set our hello and dad timers to a longer interval.

11:27.130 --> 11:34.870
We don't want our routing protocol to trigger it's dead timer.

11:34.940 --> 11:43.190
We don't want that dead timer to expire because then let's say for example we're using OSPF if the OSPF

11:43.190 --> 11:49.040
dead timer expires while the active is failing over to the stand by.

11:49.040 --> 11:54.440
We're going to have to reconversion our routing tables and that's going to create an even longer outage.

11:56.490 --> 12:02.370
So because of this the recommended dead time for OSPF is 120 seconds.

12:02.410 --> 12:06.460
Let's get into a little bit more detail about how this fell overworks

12:10.470 --> 12:17.830
So under normal operations the NSX edge has a IP address and a MAC address.

12:17.910 --> 12:24.300
The activity has has the IP address and there's actually a shared IP address that the standby edge also

12:24.300 --> 12:32.850
has however the standby edge is a different virtual machine and it has a unique MAC address.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.380
So if the active edge fails.

12:35.580 --> 12:37.700
Here's essentially what is going to happen.

12:37.870 --> 12:38.060
Right.

12:38.060 --> 12:39.340
The active edge fails.

12:39.350 --> 12:40.070
It's gone.

12:40.070 --> 12:42.050
It's out of the picture.

12:42.080 --> 12:50.770
The standby edge will now issue something called a gratuitous ARP and what the purpose of the gratuitous

12:50.770 --> 12:58.060
ARP is essentially the standby edge is saying to the physical router Hey physical router my mac address

12:58.060 --> 12:59.200
is changed.

12:59.230 --> 13:00.960
The IP is still the same.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.800
The neighbor relationship is still maintained.

13:03.850 --> 13:06.000
We're just changing the MAC address.

13:06.490 --> 13:12.490
It'll also send that gratuitous ARP to the logical routing control VM to inform it that hey the IP remains

13:12.490 --> 13:13.080
the same.

13:13.150 --> 13:21.850
But I now have a new MAC address and by doing this it can maintain those neighbor relationships without

13:21.880 --> 13:26.870
OSPF having to reroute traffic.

13:26.940 --> 13:33.630
So again it's very important that we properly configure not only the virtual network but the physical

13:33.630 --> 13:41.130
network as well so that during that brief downtime of let's say 15 seconds or the active just failing

13:41.130 --> 13:49.330
over to the standby we do not want our OSPF dead timer to get triggered during that fail over process.

13:49.350 --> 13:54.930
I want to fail over to complete what the standby adds to send out a gratuitous ARP and take over those

13:54.930 --> 13:56.350
neighbor relationships.

14:02.750 --> 14:10.400
Now finally let's take a look at how NSX edge high availability works hand in hand with VSE for high

14:10.400 --> 14:17.070
availability and in this case we've got four ESX host in our environment.

14:17.100 --> 14:20.430
We've got the active edge running on host ESX 0 3.

14:20.460 --> 14:26.820
We've got the Stand by Edge on ESX zero for their files are on different data stores as well.

14:29.530 --> 14:33.460
And all of our hosts have access to both of these data source.

14:33.500 --> 14:38.570
This is important and is their recommended configuration.

14:38.640 --> 14:43.910
So let's assume that host ESX size 0 3 fails right.

14:43.920 --> 14:50.320
That's the host that my active NSX was running on.

14:50.330 --> 14:58.850
So now my active ANOSIKE surge is down and the host that was on has failed and the active NSX adj is

14:58.850 --> 15:07.380
gone well at this point NSX edge high availability will be used to fail over to that standby edge and

15:07.380 --> 15:09.700
the standby edge will now take over.

15:09.710 --> 15:17.310
It will issue that gratuitous ARP to take over those neighbor relationships that the other ad used to

15:17.820 --> 15:25.650
be in charge of ADD Now these fair high availability will kick in.

15:25.790 --> 15:26.000
Right.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.540
My files are still available down there and data store too.

15:29.660 --> 15:32.750
So that old Dadge can be booted up on some other host.

15:32.900 --> 15:36.330
And when it does get booted up it's going to come in as the standby.

15:36.380 --> 15:40.300
That's not going to preempt the other edge and take over as the active.

15:40.490 --> 15:42.320
It'll come back as they stand by each

15:45.950 --> 15:52.870
Sylvie's for high availability and NSX edge high availability really worked very nicely together because

15:52.880 --> 16:00.470
the Wii's for high availability essentially serves to protect the NSX edge should some failure occur

16:04.480 --> 16:06.310
so let's take a couple of minutes to review.

16:06.310 --> 16:12.820
Now in this lesson we learned about the NSX and how it's in the data plan and how it's very important

16:13.120 --> 16:18.200
that we quickly restore the NSX edges functionality.

16:18.370 --> 16:26.620
Should a failure occur NSX edge high availability works by creating a standby I-ness Accenture.

16:26.630 --> 16:28.610
There's going to be an active and a Stand by.

16:28.780 --> 16:35.340
And if the act fails the stand by we'll take over the stand by detects that failure because it stops

16:35.340 --> 16:41.910
receiving heartbeats from the act of which this failure can take anywhere from 15 seconds to as low

16:41.910 --> 16:42.890
as six seconds.

16:42.990 --> 16:48.780
But again the minimum configuration recommended is a nine second dead timer.

16:50.730 --> 16:58.680
And we also saw how NSX edge high availability works hand-in-hand with very high availability to protect

16:58.680 --> 17:03.530
the NSX Sache and restart those edge virtual machines if a host fails.
